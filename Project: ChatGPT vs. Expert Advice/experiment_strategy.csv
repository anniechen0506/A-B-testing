1633,"I estimated how many were in a specific area, the extrapolated that to the rest of the group, depending on how dense I felt the remaining areas were"
1395,I marked a really small square and counted the number of blue dots inside. Then I divided the picture into the estimated number of similar squares and simply multiplied.
1386,what i did was divided each part of the screen into smaller sections then counted how many people where in that section and then estimated how many sections there would be
1230,I looked at the amount of people and tried to think about capacity sizes I do know. I then tried to mentally compare those sizes (such as a large theatre) to the number of people in the photo and came to my conclusion.
1115,"counted the number of people I could see in the bottom left hand corner, and then multiplied that number by the grid I estimated the size of the photo to be, and rounded the number up a little (guesstimation) to take into account the people being closer together/more in a grid portion in the upper portions"

565,I counted 1 row and estimated the rest with that in mind.
1507,First counted 10 people to get an estimated area. Using this estimate I divided the total area with it and got 500 then multiplied by 10 to get the final answer of 5000
1118,i counted a small patch and then multiplied the number of people in that patch by the height of the picture (so 5x5 people high) and then the same again wide. Then I added some extra people because the depth of the photo means there's more people in a smaller space toward the back.
313,"I took into account that the people are at a stadium, The stadium looked packed which could mean it was sold out and I tried to estimate how many seats there are based of off general knowledge."

92,i counted a few of the below that were closer to the edge of the picture and tried to estimate based on that
432,Very roughly counted the number of rows of people and then roughly divided the picture into columns without being too concerned about accuracy because the rows were already different sizes.

77,tried to see how many dots there are on a row and get a rough estimate (increments of 250) .It seemed to be between 750 and 1000 to me
942,"I tried to count one row"" in the middle then multiply that with the amount of rows. I knew it would be a tricky to estimate because of the varying density so I rounded it out to 50 x 30 = 1500"""
423,"I thought about past experiences with full rooms of people and knowing how many people where there; I usually naturally think there are less than there are, so now I just assume double or something"

1018,Just an estimation based on the density and size of the picture.it was not very much scientific
704,it was normal counting dots

1495,"I just thought: Huh, these people are in a stadium. The capacity of a stadium can go to 50-60,000 people. Then I let my brain do the rest of work, i.e. I just looked at the number of people, and picked the number that seemed right that came up in my brain!"
1786,"quickly counted blue dots in a line, multiplied by number of rows i could counts and added a few 100s for good measure"

1378,I counted the average row amount and average column amount and multiplied the numbers. 
723,I looked at 1 row of people and did a quick count. Then I looked at the whole picture and had an educated guess as to the number of rows and people. I also thought about my memory of standing in front of 300 people and what that looked like and compared it.

1713,"First I estimated a random group of people then looked at how much of the screen it took up, so 10 people and it was a small portion. Then I checked how many rows and also realized that one side would be denser due to distance from camera. Finally I counter one of the shortest rows to see how many where at the bottom and then guestimate how many rows to make sure my guess was sound."
948,"Firstly tried to count the rows of people, then tried to estimate how many might be in an average."
1668,i guessed that was probably 10% of the stadium

680,I counted 10 blue dots and then tried to roughly count 10 by 10.
729,uneducated guess 
1855,"I counted 10 people in a row, then tried to estimate how many times 10 fit in one row, and then multiplied that with an approximation of rows"
235,going on previous crowds i have saw
348,I actually counted few dots on the first row which gave me an insight on the estimation that each row may be. This lead to my final guess or estimation of the number of the crowd in the picture.
218,based on my knowledge on stadiums and roughly estimating the average of people in the area I gathered the final value
943,i just went by intuition to be honest

89,"I took into consideration the average size of a person, as we as a rough eye measurement of the length and width of the room. "
405,I just guessed. I thought about counting the rows but it was too tricky so I just estimated it based on that it looked like more than 1000 so I went for 2000
1862,I estimated how many people were in one section and then multiplied it by the number of sections. 
9,"I just estimated by how closed packed they are, they're squeezed next to each other. It looked like there were 2 people for every one seat."
1106,"I tried to count at least a couple of rows, and roughly multiplied by the number of visible rows. It's a crude system, but in this way I at least intuited a vague number that could be consistent with the photograph."
388,I estimated the number of people in one row and then multiplied it by estimated number of rows.

406,I have been to many large sporting events at large stadiums and have rough idea of how many people are in a block of seats.
720,I tried to look at the number of lines and gave a rough estimate per section. multipled by estimation to the rest in the picture.
1488,"It's a stadium so there must be a lot of people but only on the picture 6-10k would be too much and anything below 2k for sure would be too little so looking how small people in the back were my best estimation was around 4,5k people"

1428,"I made a rough estimate of how many people there were in each row and how many there were, I didn't count the lower ones and just added a flat number to the estimate to round up."
1717,i guessed and then i looked at an areaband guessed again
24,"I roughly tried to count how many was on the line and then counted the amount of rows and then roughly guessed what that doubled would be, and guesstimated from there!"
1229,I thought back to when I went to a concert at a stadium and tried to estimate who many people were there in comparison to my experience. I also just tried to use my best judgment to guess how many people there were. 
1032,"I roughly looked at the number of rows and then people in each row, but I realised it's a difficult thing to do. I thought about the capacity of stadiums I know and tried to look at it this way, as a certain portion of a stadium."
1095,"counted a small area, x by howmany of those area I thought there were"
1503,"I made a guess on the number of rows, then guessed the number in each row. I compared this with how many might be in a football crowd and added a zero to my first number"
996,I started by counting the amount of blue dots in the biggest line. I then counted how many rows of people there were. I used my best guess based on the amount of people in the biggest line to guess an appropriate number of people within the photo.
300,"I think what I did is count people in a small"" square and multiply it in my head by the number of squares I think the photo had. So more or less that but I think I put low number.”"
1884,Counted the first group in the right hand corner then continued to double the estimate each section
621,"One row on the bottom was about 150 people, there are about 20 rows on the bottom, top looked like 2x of whats at the bottom."
1640,"I thought of high school and the crowds that would watch sporting events, we were a school of 1200 and I just used that as a reference to estimate"

224,had to estimate the number of people in a section of crowd at a sporting event/concert.
796,"I counted the size of a 10 people group and saw how many groups fitted in 1/4 of the crowd, it was around 500 people. Multiplied by 4 but put some people less because not every 1/4 sector of the picture had the same density of people."
220,"I roughly estimated the amount of people in 1 row, then roughly estimated the amount of rows. Accounting for some kind of variability because of the uneven distribution of people."
659,Vague blue dot count by blocks.
93,I just tried to guess at first sight
273,counted just over two hundred people in the top section so I assumed it was more than double in the bottom.
437,"I divided the pictures in 16 parts. I calculated (aprox) that there were 90 people in each part, so I just multiplied it."

696,counted a small area of 10 people multiplied by 10 then visually counted large sections of 100
1864,"Not much, guessed that the bottom half was a couple of thousand then doubled it"
305,I took a square of what I roughly estimated to contain 100 people then multiplied it by how much bigger I thought the picture was
1449,I counted around how many rows there were. Estimated around how many people were in each row and then multiplied it by the number of rows.
1456,I took the average people in row volume and roughly counted how many rows there were. I then did number of people x rows

374,I had a look to see if there were any empty seats. I also looked at how many rows may be at the stadium.
563,I roughly counted a single row close to the bottom. Then I counted the number of rows I see. Multiplied these numbers. Then I wanted to account for the perspective by multiplying it with 2-3. And finally adjusted my guess intuitively.
560,Counted dots at the bottom. Counted dots in the left without the area with higher intensity. Multiplied. Added approximate amount of blue dots in a higher density area.

311,I imagined how many people fit in a stadium and compared the size of the crowd to a full stadium
191,Try counting the heads at horizontaly at top and multiplying it by the number of heads vertically
1842,"I counted the rows to have been approx. 30 people deep and then counted the rows across which took me to around 1200, then added another 300 due to the perspective of the photo for those in the far distance I was unable to see clearly."

1669,I thought about football crowds t matches that I have intended and tried to interpolate
1848,"What I did to estimate how many people were in the picture was add up the number of blue dots on the bottom, and make that number slightly higher (Because the bottom row is short) and then roughly square that number. "
490,"I divide the sections into 2. The top section had more people than the bottom. I counted the people in a small area ""a strip both at the top and at the bottom. I then counted the number of strips in the picture. I multiped the number of people at the top by the number of strips. I did the same with the people at the bottom and then added the totals of the top and the bottom together."""
689,"Divide the image into equal rectangles, then count how many points there were in one rectangle and estimate that it would be the same for the others. clearly the top half has more so I did the same for the bottom half but counting again"

1638,"I tried figuring out the area of a cluster"" of dots. For each area"
1085,"Upper level were more dense, I counted 10 precisely and estimated 9 other area with about he same dot count so I got a 100. I put this 100 area as many times as I could at the upper section. I did the same with the lower level."

899,look at the picture and say how many people approximately are in the picture
975,"Whenever I try to estimate the number of objects somewhere, I try to look at the entire thing first to get a sense of the space. Then I just briefly counted the people on the highest and lowest areas and just did my best to imagine the number of people filling up the rest of the space."

790,just quickly guess the amount of people X the number of rows
427,"I focused on one of the corners (botton right) there were around 50 people. Then, knowing that information,  I tried to calculated the rest of the lines. I was about to put 2500 but then I realised there were too many so I raised to 3000"
1331,I grouped 10 people and tried to see how much of the picture it covered

296,i just sort of guessed by the amount of people who fit in my local stadium
373,"I counted the number of blue dots, which seemed to identify the head of each person, in the first few rows to get an estimate about their size and increase with each following one. Then I counted the number of rows for my calculation."
1340,1
1478,I counted atleast half and then made an estimate 
600,I estimated a single line across (around 60) and then estimated a single line vertical (about 25). I then multiplied the two numbers and went for a rounded answer around that ballpark.
261,I thought about a hockey stadium that I knew and guesstimated from there by comparing.

380,"It was a complete guess, I did not make any calculations whatsoever. "
654,"I tried estimating 10 people, 100 then 1000"
1399,i counted a in one quadrant then estimated for 4 quadrants
500,I estimated 20 people per row and 28 rows.
36,I counted how many people marked are in a part of the picture and then multiplied it 
1519,compared this to stadium that I have actually been to and felt more people in the picture than you originally think there is
1715,I just estimated based on the number of seats at an average stadium. I then made made an estimate from there.
545,"Idk, it was just a random number"
211,"I divided it into small squares, counted how many squares there are on average, and multiplied them"
1226,Its a big section of a crowd in a large looking stadium. I thinks its about a third of a 25000 capacity stadium
1240,Tried to count row by colun to determine the number o people in one row/colum. from there count of the number if the same sized rows. then adjust per shift in size
195,I counted the blue dots on their heads. 
376,i just estimated by gut feeling looking at the dots
974,"I made an estimate, it doesn't make much sense."
368,divided the image into squares of about 10 people
48,I just tried to measure them and I have tried to imagine this stadium in the real world.
973,"I counted roughly the number of people in the first, smaller row, and on the last, larger row, and multiplied the average by number of rows"
306,I understood that this is a football stadium. Usually these stadiums are really big (40-60k on average). Then I just guessed that one section would up to 1000 people
1360,I split it into smaller sections of roughly a 100 and counted how many possible sections there are
1067,I used my best guesstimate based on visually looking at the picture.
777,i counted a row  portion of the seats and multiplied the by the rest of rows in the area. then guessed thats aproximate value of all areas and estimated the number

68,"First I measured with a finger the size of 10 people, then 100 with two fingers making a rectangle then went from there to count them all"
644,estimated number of people per row 
1561,tried to count how many people were in the first row then how many rows there were then added some extra
122,I tried to count the people in small groups and multiplied by the number of groups I thought were in the photograph
1657,The area captured in the picture looked similar to one side at my local arena. Did an estimate based on that.
298,"I compared it to a group i was apart of previously, knowing that groups attendance was about 2300. This picture looks to be a couple hundred less people"
365,I literally just tried estimating a number I thought would make sense after looking at it for a while as instructed.
177,"Took a guess.  Thought of a stadium holding 20,000 people and estimated this picture was 1/20th of the stadium."
541,"Rough counted the persons per row and the number of rows, then multiplied"
1613,I counted the first row of people and from there l was able to determine how many people in total were in the picture
441,"I looked at the length of one row and tried to estimate how many people were in that, then estimated the number of rows. The total seemed far too high, however, and I think there's a tendency to overestimate the size of crowds (cf. Trump), so I revised my estimate downwards."
1138,Roughly estimated how many rows there were on each section (assumed 30 bellow and 30 above) and then roughly estimated how many people fit in each row (assumed around 70)
731,"I calculated the left bottom, routhly sketched it by 10 people, then 100 and tried to groupthat over the rest. But because top has a different perspective, i added some more."
455,"Just took a guess and estimated from previous crowd pictures I have seen. I know what 5000, 10000, 20000 etc looks like, so I made a guess at this."
1246,"I tried guesstimating"" how many people were in one small rectangular section then used that section as a reference to estimate how many people were in similarly sized sections and therefore the whole picture. But the number still fell too short of what my eyes and mind were perceiving so I ended up deciding on 20 000 for no reason other tan it feels more correct"""
756,I took a rough count of the number of people across a horizontal line in the picture and multiplied it by the same for a vertical line
889,estimate the number of people in a very similarly colored crowd
1124,"I roughly counted one of the rows below. I multiplied the figure by the lines and segments with which I had divided the screen. I visualized this figure moving virtually and roughly seeing if such a quantity could correspond to the audience in the stands, and then rounded down."
1648,"It was mostly just an attempt at educated"" guesswork. By guiding myself through the blue circles"
1548,looked at numbers in strips. estimated number of strips and multiples this
194,estimated by a percentage of a stadium capacity
139,I counted the first dots and then how many people approximately can be there.
1737,"I counted many people are in rows and columns, then multiplied that"
630,i looked at the heads and estimated according to my previous knowledge of stadium capacities.
1678,"I tried to count heads for one row, and then count rows but the density was vastly different further back. My estimation is probably far off."
446,"I tried to  count the people as a column and then multiplied times over, and also tried to base one personal experience on being in a similar building."
1828,"Started counting a few, thought it was just too many to count to a decent number and just thought, right, if this little space fits 10 people then the whole lot should be around 1500 to 2000."
71,"I made an estimate for both the lower and the upper side for a small box, about a tenth of the picture half, and then extrapolated this. "
634,"Looked across the top, assumed about 30 people in the first row... Maybe more like 30-40... Then I looked at the vertical axis and I knew more than 10 was aligned on that sp I stayed safe with 10 because of the space between people. So it could be like 600 but I just wanted to aim lower."
963,"I started by looking at the number of seats per row in a section, which appeared to be around 10-12. I then looked at the number of rows, which was also around 10-12, so I estimated about 1000 per section. Then I counted the sections and it was around 7-8 sections on each of the two levels for a total of approximately 14000."
378,First tried to estimate the number of people in a middle row. Then estimated the number of rows. Double checked that buy saying that this image is about 10-15% of a stadium is whould hold about x people
1604,I grouped them in what i think 100 people would look like then started circling the âhundredsâ i see until i got to that number
1598,Just estimate how many people based on the rows
158,I just tried my best to estimate what the number is. I didn't count them or anything I just guessed.
994,I sectioned off a part of the crowd and made a small estimate of how many people were in that section. Then I multiplied my guess across the entire crowd.
609,I estimated the number of rows and then the number of people in each row using my own personal experience of how people are seated in stadiums and roughly how much space they take combined with an estimate of how much and how far the picture showed.
1154,Pure estimate 
726,"I tried to picture how many usually fit on a typical city bus, I would guess that is about 100, I tried to group bus-fulls of people, if that makes any sort of sense."
232,"Knowing that many stadiums can take a capacity of about 10000 people and also knowing that the amount of students in university is about 2500 -3000 people, based on research. I deduced that the amount of people in the picture were somewhere in the 2000s because they were way too small to be 5000 - 10000."
1194,I imagined an arena and estimated its capacity then guessed the percentage of that shown in the pucture to give a rough number.
1412,tried to figure out how many were in an inch square and multiplied by the number of squares
1321,I've estimated how many people were in approximately 1 square centimeter of the picture. Then I multiplied that with how many I thought square centimeters was in the picture.
1402,"I saw a lot of bodies and faces in the crowd of people. I imagine they are in a very large arena for a gathering, whether it be a sports game or a show. I guessed about how many people it may be based on the idea that they are in a large arena. "
1468,I've count the first row and then tryin to do the math counting rows 
1755,"seemed like a pretty even distibution of people so i made and esimate size of a square that had about 20 people. Then i estimated how many times that square fit into the image, then multipled all together"
1296,"I counted 5 people. then doubled the area to make 10, then calculated the rough number of 100s along the bottom. It appeared to be 800. I then counted up to see how many of these lines I could make and found it was 5; which I multiplied by 800 to make 4000."
773,I tried to count as best as I could how many people were in a single row and estimated from there.
60,Counted the few bottom lines and established a trend on how the rows increase. And made a calculated guess
857,I counted how much space a group of 10 people occupied. The crowd looked pretty evenly distributed so I estimated by eyeballing it.
1041,Counted atleast a fraction of the crowd and then made my estimate 
22,"Firstly counted a portion equivalent to 10people, then subsequently divide the whole area with that portion of 10people.."
73,"I thought about the secondary school I went to, which had about 800 pupils in it.  I visualised us all gathered for morning assembly and what that looked like in terms of a crowd of people.  I then divided the crowd in the picture into sections I thought roughly corresponded to a group of 800, and found about three such sections in the picture.  Hence my total of 2500."
426,I went by guessing the amount of people based off the amount of dots in the picture.
1050,Guessed how many people are in the picture 
1843,i did count bunch of people then moved it on other side of the sits
319,I counted a square and tried to see how many squares are in the picture. 
357,i started counting in the most populated area and then muliplyied the top areas. I did the same in the bottom more sparce area and then totaled the two together. i then reduced it by about 50 for the over estimate
829,I tried to caculate the number o raw and the number of person per raw.
776,I saw the picture and calculated it based on concerts that i have gone to.
985,"I counted the rows of people and the number of persons in one row and multiplied it,"
164,Looked for 10 people in a row and multiplied it out throughout the image.
1181,I tought of it like a rectangle. I used my thumb for collumns and each collumns represented 10 people (there were 7 collumns) and for lines I estimated around 7. 7*70=490 so I rounded it up to 500
2,Best guesstimate just by visually the size and volume of people.
1188,Attempted to count a rough number of people but gave up and just took a random guess 
114,I attempted to estimate how many people were within a certain block. I then multiplied that number by the estimated number of times I felt that block was replicated.
286,Because based on the number of blue dots and the seating.
1477,I first counted a row of people in a single column then multiplied by that total row
470,Iâve observed the picture and I made my best guess. 
577,Thinking about a concert and how many people are in each section
1274,"Started counting to see what a 10x10 grid would look like. Then guesses from there. Also imagined my local stadium that I know seats 40k, that looked a bit over a section. Hard to estimate though having never been forced to before."
197,I tried to estimate the number of people per row and then tried to count the rows. 
1433,I counted how many people there are approximately in one row and multiplied it by the number of rows.
1293,i counted a small section and multiplied by similar sections
1565,"I took a random portion and count the people inside it, I divided the picture in portions of same size and then multiplied the initial number of persons with the number of portions.."
1845,Counted 20 people and looked at what approximate area they occupy. Then counted how many times that area repeats in the image and multiplied by 20.
840,"I have been to a full lecture hall that houses 300 students. This looks about three times as big, so I guessed 900-1000. My gut instinct said it's on the higher side, so I went with 1000."
667,I counted approx 10 people closest to me & then tried to estimate how many other groups of 10 were in the picture.
1462,I counted the number of people in one row using the purple dots. I then tried to estimate how many rows there were in total and guess the number of people. 
385,Did a rough estimate of how many people were in a small group and then that size multiply it by the times I thought that size was in the picture
19,I divided the picture in 2 halves (upper and lower since there is a difference in desity). After that i estimated how many dots i saw per half and added them up.
1335,I knew it was one section of a decent sized stadium. I know roughly how much stadiums can hold so I guesstimated based on how much of the section was visible. 
345,"I tried to count approxamitely one row, and then one column, and after guessing the widest row was about 100 people and there was about 10+ rows I thought the number is gonna be huge, about 2000-4000, I didn't count for long, but I think it'll be around 3000+"
1064,I estimated a small section of people then I tried to copy that over into other areas. I tried to take into account different perspective but I think I messed up.
283,"I performed a rough count of those in a row along the lower tier, and multiplied that figure by the number of rows.  Then I looked at the more densely populated upper tier, and reckoned that the number present would be around double the number in the lower tier."
934,"first ive counted 10 in the corner, then estimate"
1611,"I tried to estimate how many people appeared to be in each quarter of the image, then multiplied that by four."
1880,I split the image into around 20 areas and counted how many people approximately were in one of these twenty areas. I got the figure of 140 and I then multiplied it by 20 to get 2800. I am sure it is wrong as some areas of the image feature very few people but it is my best guess.
1760,I just roughly divided the people into gropus of 10 and made an approximate calculation by takinga a quick look.
747,"I tried counting the people who were at the edges, and then multiplying that by eye with the amount of dots I could see in groups little by little."
15,I compared the amount of people to a school/stadium of fans to work it out
1792,"I tried estimating the number of people in each row on the below deck and assumed it to be 1000. Then i noticed that it appears as though the way the picture was shot, that the people in the deck below are similarly the same as the number of people in the above deck. So i concluded it is probably 2000 if not above."
1626,I broke the picture down into what looked like sections of the stadium and counted across one row of seats then applied this to each section then took some away for gaps(stairwells etc)
1299,I tried to estimate how many people per row and how many rows there are
1593,took a small section and guessed that number of people then extrapolated that to the larger picture 
1783,It was a complete guess
953,"I roughly estimated 10 people in one section, went across 8 times and roughly 10 down. 10x10x8 is 800."
1883,"Thinking about how many people would fill a venue that size,."
234,"I estimated the amount of people there may be in one row, and then attempted to guess how many rows there were"
1877,I just looked at the blue spots that I saw which represented their heads then made a decision according to those blue spots/dots
1656,"I used the front row as a baseline, and looked at the next row above it to estimate the increments."
1269,I estimated the size of the group.
459,"i counted how many rows there were (on average) and how many people a row had, and multiplied them"
1385,Imagined a concert hall of similar size which I know holds 3900.
1417,it was mostly intuition. 
1551,"I counted the people in one column then multiplied it by the number of rows, it was difficult as the photo is quite small on my device"
877,counting to estimate 100 participants and then estimating based on this
347,I started counting people in a small area and then doubling the number.
536,Counted a fraction of the people and then made an estimate 
1887,"I tried to count lower dots, then estimate how many times more of them were in the upper part of picture"
1125,"I counted an entire row, and then counted how many rows there were. Then, I multiplied both numbers."
314,I tried to think of a football stadium and divided by how small a space the picture filled.
1021,"I used as reference a famous indoor arena in my country, where I went a few times. The picture seemed to have about 1/4 of the size of that reference arena, and it looked packed, so I estimated there were about 1/4 of the capacity of that arena I thought of"
258,"Just look at the proportion of the stadium, which i know they can fit lots of people and i just guessed it"
1058,I tried to determine the number based on a visual count per row
1578,counted people in one row then multiplied by 100
1863,"randomly guessing the number of people in the picture. Count a small corner of people there and then estimate about how corner"" will it has in the whole picture"""
297,I guessed the amount of people in the picture of a stadium
1270,"I counted one row of people and got 47, so based on the length I guessed that there were about 30 people in a column and multiplied 30x47 then rounded up to 1500 because some areas were more dense."
929,"I tried to count the rows of seats/people and then counted the number of people in one of these rows. I used these two numbers to multiply and get an average estimation. When multiplying I overestimated a little to account for what seemed like denser groups of people etc. I added an extra 500 onto my total estimation as it didn't seem like my initial estimation of around 2,000 people would have been correct."
129,Counted approximately 10 people within a square. Then counted approximately how many squares of 10 there were in the picture. Higher density equals more squares.
764,"Impossible to count, rough estimate, the blue dots helped a little to calculate"
115,I assumed the place could hold around 20000 people and saw it was only a section of the arena so I guessed 3000
749,"I tried counting how many people were in one of the middle rows and looked at how many rows"" of people there looked to be in the picture (roughly). I multiplied the two figures and then corrected it slightly to allow for the fact that there were fewer people at the front of the picture and more people towards the back of the picture."""
1130,I calculated the blue dots in the corner about 1/5 of the entire screen and then just added that to the remaining portion of the screen. I assumed it had approximately about the same ammount of blue dots
1890,I compared what i saw to compareable stands at events i've been to and determined what it would be as a % of the overall capacity of the arena i'd been to
991,I thougt of the number of people a staduim can hold.
1358,I saw how much was 10 people and just tried to guess based on that
32,I looked at the crowd and made an educated guess 
663,I looked at how many people were in a row and estimated based on what I could see in the image.
1839,I thought about university and how many student it required  to fill 3 lecture room and tripled that number. tr
1028,"I counted the number of blue dots on the vertical and horizontal sides. I came up to about 100*25 = 2500. But seeing that the people are not spread uniformly and there is empty space in the middle, I decreased the number. Pretty much eyeballing only"
691,"I counted a number of people in a determinated area, and with the area size in mind and number of people I just tried too see how many times that area would fit in the picture and estimated the number of people"
955,I counted a inch of people and then guessed from there to how many 
1420,"I estimated based on the size of the stadium , "
727,I basically took a bit of stock of the scene using the blue dots and then just guessed. 
806,counted one row it was about 50 then i counted how many rows
1284,"Looking at the picture, I estimated a percentage of people that would be around a 100. I think looked at the picture as a whole and guessed how many blocks of a 100 people it would fit within."
619,I looked horizontally and vertically and roughly counted how many I thought were in each row or column and multiplied them by each other.
928,I averaged a group...and then counted how many similar sized groups.
1621,I counted a small group of people and tried to times that with the number of how many people I thought where in the small group I first focused on
1695,"I envisioned a full sports stadium thst can hold around 100000, then estimated thst the picture wss about 1 fifth of a complete stadium"
623,I thought about photos oflarge groups I have seen previously and thought about how any comments estimated how many people were there
494,"I looked at approximately how many people were in the first few rows, and tried to use that to estimate how many people there were in total."
381,I tried to count the rows and how many people would be in one row in the photo.
547,I deduced how many 100 hundreds of people and roughly summed them together
1853,"I counted the amount of heads roughly vertically, then diagonally then multiplied the two"
1526,"There were about 26 people in the lowest right corner row, 35 in the next row above, so I figured possibly there would be 9 more in every row above. I finally lost count and made my best guess."
1738,Imagined a grid system. Tried to count the number of people in one column and then multiplied it by an estimated number of columns
111,I tried to think about what the average stadium size might be and go with that. The picture looked like an average stadium 
688,by guessing
1720,I counted a small section and then multiplied it across the whole photo to get an estimate
1873,"I counted twenty people, visualised what space they took up then tried to apply it to the whole picture. I think I've actually over estimated."
695,i counted out the largest row and estimated from there
958,"I just had a rough guess at how many people would be visible within the scope of the picture, since it wasn't a super long distance shot covering an entire arena as an example, I used that to have a rough idea of what to expect."
1860,tried diving the people displayed in the piture into groups of 100.
138,"Counted roughly 1/4 across the the width and length, then multiplied each by 4, then multiplied those answers together."
157,I thought about how many people fit in a stadium and how many people might be sitting in a certain section
1808,"worked out number of people per row approx and counted number of rows in picutre, did simple multiplication"
989,"I tried counting in a row and column and multiplying, although the blue dots were really small."
445,Roughly counted areas in between stairs as it is the repeating pattern. Multiplied it with how many time it is repeated
1342,Estimated one row and then multiplied by an estimate of the number of rows
1185,"It looks like the same amount of people in my high school pep rally, which would consist of 500-600 students."
531,"I started counting the people, but the I stressed out so I stopped and guess just by seeing the image."
601,Can you guide me a little by the blue dots in the image?
1225,"I Just tought that they weren't so many people, I think for each lines there was something like 300 people and so, for about 10-15 lines I thought about 4000 people"
765,Counted a few heads then scanned the full picture counting in 100 blocks
1773,"After looking at the image for quite some time (more than i care to admit), i concluded it looked like a lot. Maybe quite a few thousand. They were small dots too in large clusters for quite big image, so i figured it would be a surprisingly large number."
1366,I counted how many people were in a line across and up and multiplied. 
515,"estimated the middle rows times the#of rows for the top ,sutracted approx 10 per row to the bottom"
222,"I thought about how my school assemblies used to look. There were a thousand pupils in my school. This picture looked bigger than this assemblies but I imagined my school assembly beig double the usual size but 2,000 seemed more than what was in the picture"
793,"I honestly just trusted my gut. I didn't use any specific strategy. I just thought about the Football Stadium here in Hannover, Germany and tried to approximate."
952,I tried to think about the scene (a football match) and how many people might be attending
1370,i just guessed
1891,"First I looked at the picture closely and then I tried to guess how many people in each row were (from left to right). After that I counted the rows (up to down), and multiplied that. And thats how I got my answer."
1558,"I determined the space that 100 (approximate) would occupy. I then estimated how many blocks of space of a similar size there were. Finally, I multiplied the number of blocks by 100 to calculate the total."
1903,I counted a line of people horizontally and vertically and multiplied the two numbers to get a result
837,I guessed a number that I thought would maybe be around the number of people there are. It looks like more than 100 and looks to be in the 1000s so I picked a number in the middle of 1000 and 10000.
693,I tried to estimate how many people there were in the picture by recalling the number of spectators in the rugby ground which I visit during the rugby season.
1596,"I thought about when I attended a soccer match that seated 85,000 people and this is a small section of what that would be."
1662,tried to estimate how many people are in a row than multiplied by the estimated amount of rows
121,"I figure it seems like around 100 people per section and the sections look like there's stairs in between, so that was my guesstimation (but I feel it might be low)."
20,"I roughly estimated how many blue dots were in a small area, then multiplied by a factor."
451,I just assumed that they might be the number i just mentioned because they are in the stadium as we all know stadium carry high number of people 
1649,"I tried i roughly broke it down into 8 smaller chunks and to guess how many would be in each section, then doubled it."
1554,"I tried counting one row of people horizontally, then vertically. I also tried to create groups of ten and see how much space they took, but it was quite difficult to guess"
959,Just looked at the perspective distance and randomly guessed! 
583,Counter across quickly and estimated how many rows although could be miles off!!
809,I just tried to estimate it by the size of the place
208,Complete and utter guess being honest. Was originally thinking maybe 10000 or so but doesn't really seem a big crowd so ended up say 1240 as it's more than a thousand but don think there is 2000
4,"I've been to quite a few concerts this year, so having that in mind and comparing the size f the venue and how many people where in the pit, I estimated the number of people that were in the picture"
1139,roughly guessed how many people could be in a row and then multiplied it by the amount of rows I estimated.
503,"I counted the people in the middle row and the number of rows of people, then did an approximation knowing some rows were shorter or larger than others."
419,It is asking to guess how many people are in the photo. 
1439,I just took a quick look at the photo and made a guess.
78,"I picked a small segment and tried to count the number of people, then I then estimted how many similar segments there were (taking into consideration that different parts of the picture had a smaller number of people."
125,vibes
1113,"It is a section of a football/soccer stadium. Normally, those stadiums take 50,000 to 80,000 people so a small section can like that in the picture could be around 10,000 to 13,000."
1879,I tried count the people in a single line and try to guess how many lines there are in a section. 10 lines x 10 people in a section = 100. I thought there would be 8 sections so 100 x 8 =800.
1900,"I looked at the zones of most and least density, to see how much apart the dots were. I grouped them in chunks of about 100 people and started counting in a rough manner."
1661,"I looked at roughly how many blue dots there were in the image, and then i thought that there was definitely over 100 so i took a guess at 300"
699,I have had the opportunity of hearing the an estimated number of a crowd similar to that based on the area of coverage..
303,i count the number of seats in a zone and i multiply by the number of zones in the image 
512,"I estimated at first how many 10 people would be in space then kind off looked at the picture a bit more and grasped the number 800, at first I thought around 700 but then changed it for a bit higher as I feel sometimes we can underestimate"
1859,Counted the blue dots in a certain area then tried to imagine the same number for a similar area
614,I relied on intuition
1630,"tried to estimate how many people were in a row of seats, estimated how many rows i could see and multiplied the results. "
954,It was something that just came to me after staring at the photo for a while no strategy 
1012,"I attempted to count the center row, then guestimated the total, based on the number of rows. I took into account that some rows were shorter or longer."
792,Rough estimate of how many blue dots per row of seats.
66,"I divided the crowd into roughly equal sections and estimated how many people were in each section, then I added up to arrive at a total number."
683,I looked how many rows there are and tried to guess how many people are in one row.
598,Sectioned off a bit of the picture that was easier to guesstimate for. Multiplied section of picture by how many sections fit for the whole picture. Did a brief sanity check at end to see if that answer would make sense.
355,"counted on the sides and multiplies that, times 100"
277,It was a guess based on football stadium people
617,"I tried to estimate so by eye, I did not count or scale, because in different places there is different density"
841,"I tried to count how many people where in a line. Also I tried to remember how many people fit on a stadium, by the picture used it felt like the photo would be 1/7th of the stadium."
193,I divided into 10 vertically in my mind and vertically went down to count the number of dots. There were around 100 in each ten parts
165,"First, I thought there would be approximately 100 people for each row of seats, next, I counted the approximate number of rows in the picture and lastly I multiplied the data and added a little bit more to the result."
422,I thought about a stadium and what I would normally think that one of the sides of the stadium would have as seat places
1885,"I counted 1 row, and estimated the rest by assuming the same set of seats in each row."
516,Just from what it looks like 
41,"estimated the size of the picture in cm2 , then estimated the number of heads in 1cm2 , then multiplied to arrive at the final number of heads"
921,I had to think about how many people were shown on the picture
400,"I tried to estimate the number of people in one row, and then estimated the number of rows, and then multiplied them together."
698,"I just made an assumption , thinking its a football field, "
168,I attempted to count the number of people in a certain section t to them use as an estimate and where it was logical
57,I thought that every blue dot is representing one people. So I guess it.
242,Looking at the rows . Trying to guesstimate . The back looks more crowded than the front . Not a full picture so trying to project in my mind a total 
393,"I zoomed in, and scanned quickly and guessed. "
415,"I counted the number of people in one row of seats. Then multiplied by the number of rows. I figured discrepancies would mostly even out ,.like fewer people in the first rows due to perspective but more in the back rows. "
1513,Guesstimate how many people in each row. Guesstimate how many rows. Multiply the 2 figures
1182, the number of heads and the area they are in 
690,I just guest it
1237,I just took a guess because I attempted to count one row of blue faces and it was to small to see
1010,I was looking at how close together they were. Also the area that these people were in
1788,I first tried to associate how many people would fit a stadium. I started to count how many people were there (trying to estimate how many per row) and then try to calculate how many people were actually there.
474,"I multiplied the area I could see - length and breadth, and made an educated guess based on that. It was more or less a gut feeling."
826,"I started counting the rows, realized that was getting me nowhere and went with a best guess based on how many people stadiums might hold."
802,i estimated where i thought 100 batches of people would be and continuesly stretched it across in my mind
1148,roughly counted number of rows I could see and then decided what would be a reasonable amount of seats per row and multiplied the two numbers
52,"i estimated a smaller section, then multiplied that by the number of smaller sections that i estimated were in the image"
1856,I noticed that the people were marked by blue dots. I tried to determine what a cluster of 10 people would look like in proportion to the rest of the photo and tried to estimate from there
520,Counted approximate number of people horizontally and vertically and added about 20%
1253,I tried to estimate how many people were in a section and then multiply it 
352,"Make a rough estimate of the number of people in a column, make a rough estimate of the number of columns, multiply together. "
428,"It looked like a section of crowd at a concert, so guessed a section"
1157,I counted a group of 10 people. I used the size of a group of 10 to then estimate 100. I then used this information to estimate how many in half of the picture and then doubled it.
1079,"Counted up heads in a small area, then tried to mentally place the area as many times as necessary to fill up the screen. Without explicitly counting, made an estimation."
509,I just did an average by how much I saw and how much I felt there would be without counting them all
1052,just imagine a row was about 60-80 people and just times this by the number of rows i could see.
1055,comparing it to crowds i had been in or seen before 
1318,I begin counting at ten dots and use my approximation in multiples of one hundred.
1034,i tried to count a row of heads and multiply it by how many columns i think i see
321,"I have been among many people, I tried to visualize it, compared to how many people are in the picture."
908,"divided the less dense bottom region into areas the approx size of my finger, counted how many there were in one section, counted the number of sections, multiplied. Repeated for the more dense top region, dividing into smaller sections and counting rows and columns"
120,"looking at the blue dots, i checked how many per section and tried to estimate on that."
1105,"I tried counting how many people were in a small corner. Then I counted how many chunks"" of the same size there were in a single line"
498,Thought about the rough capacity of a stadium and how much that looked like as a percentage.
847,i looked at the area that approximately 10 people occupied and the extrapolated from there. 100 people occupy 10 times the space as 10 and 1000 people take up 10 times the space as 100. then i just estimated how many times 1000 people would fit in that area
670,One row is about N ammount of people. There are approximately X rows. N*X=...
320,"Looked at the picture, saw that each of the blue dots represented a person. Figured there were alot of them, and 50000 is a big number."
133,"Sectioned off part of picture, estimated for that part. Multiplied by how many sections for the entire picture. Sanity check at end."
724,"Imagining the crowd as a table (like in excel for example), estimate the number of rows and columns with esch cell representing a person, followed by multiplication of these two numbers."

1766,"Counted (estimated) people in each row. Counted (estimated) number of rows, and multiplied both numbers."
1460,i was asked how many people were in the picture
292,I just tried to estimate the number of people based on the picture
1271,Kind of confusing.Pretty hard to guess due to the angle the photo was taken 
616,I started to think about my local soccer stadium and how many people can fit in there. Then I tried to guesstimate I many people would fit in that particular area of the stadium. 
360,I was asked to estimate the number of people in a crowd. Each person was marked with a marker.
88,i had a quck count of a row and a pultipled with the estimated rows adding a 10%
742,"I just simply guessed, it looked like a lot of people "
1164,"counted approx number of rows and people in rows, multiplied"
514,Guess the amount. Mostly by eye and sectioning off bits. 
932,I simply tried determine a line of people how many are them and then tried figure out how many rows there and just multiplied it .
100,I eye-balled the number of people in the crowd. 
875,I counted rows and then multiplied the bottom rows and the top rows and guess around 1600 would be close.
1080,"counted how many people was in a row, then counted how many rows in each box"" section. Multiplied by how many ""boxes"" I thought there was"""
1310,I started with the rows closest to me in the lower level. Those came up to 605 and I estimated the rest really quickly and came up with 720. Decided to double it to account for the ones on top.
524,I think they are in the stadium. I obtained an estimated result by dividing into groups of 50 people.
1631,I was thinking about number of seats in a typical stadium sector of this size.
544,"I tried looking at the picture as a matrix, and multiply the number of columns"" with the number of ""rows"". I multiplied 20 (vertical) with 35 (horizontal)."""
1074,I just tried to think of the size of the arena where I live and how much it sits and then tried to think of how much of an arena is shown in this photo. 
1688,"I estimated how many people fill up a stadium (about 80000 people). Then, I imagined a section of that stadium and how much that picture would fit into a stadium."
383,Split up the people into groups and estimate based on those groups
555,I counted roughly the amount of people vertically and horizontally trying to account for the curvature that caused more or less going vertical and horizontally
67,I tried to look at how many people I could see and compare it to other crowds I had seen. Then I thought about football and the size of crowd they get and what this section might equate to
464,Tried counting the people in the width of the section and the length and then multiplying them. Done this for the upper section as well and added them.
1234,"I looked at the amount of people there and thought how many usually fit in one of the areas which is about 1000,then looked at the over overcrowded areas and increased upon that"
1515,I estimated the number of people in each row. Then I estimated the number of rows and sections. Finally I multiplied them all together.
409,Looked at the image and tried to size it in a football stadium 
1023,I just counted a portion  and multiply by similar portionportions.
58,I thought about my school assembly number and superimposed the image on the photo 
1076,"I just remembered things like stadiums, auditoriums and churches and thought about the usdual numbers in those buildings since the picture allude to somethjng like that."
1001,I estimated the capacity of the stadium and assumed it could accommodate about 80 000 people
863,"I made a first guess, decided it was too big, estimated it down too far, I thought, and so pitched my final guess in the middle"
76,"i tried to calculate how many rows are there (~25) and how many people are there in 1 row (took random one, got 70). i multiplied both values and got 1750, which semms pretty possible in my opinion"
646,I chose a section. I counted th number of people. I multiplied tha by the number of sections in the image
896,I tried to count one group and estimated how many there were in total
1309,Randomly
233,"a typical stadium, of, I'm guessing that size, would be around 18,000 to 23,000, or so. So that was a corner section of that size, roughly speaking."
1675,I just guessed. There looked a lot of people
1535,It was estimated based on general capacity of this type of sporting event 
1575,"I just went with my intuition, I counted a couple of dots and imagined that amount multiplied a few times"
851,The number of people in the photograph was ascertained by counting the blue circles.
1172,At first I tried to count but it was too many people. I just guessed a number that seemed close. I didn't feel like I had any good ideas on how to make a better guess.
1795,Total guess
209,"I counted a section of the blue dots on people's heads (10), and then tired to estimate how many lots of that were along one of the longest lines of people (about 10 lots, so 100). I then took into account both the more dense grouping at the top left and the less dense grouping at the bottom right, to estimate the total."
995,i just eyeballed it
1552,looked at the amount of blue caps. then I simply guessed.
185,So first make an approximate count for each row of seats try differences thanks to the separations between each row once taking into account the total of the rows make an approximation of the number of people that fit between each row finally I wanted to leave a margin of 10% since there are people who are outside the row of seats set
787,i just looked on the people and the seat 
1594,I counted some of the blue dots presumably representing people in a quarter of the image and drew a rough estimate from that 
1837,I typed how much people I think is in the picture
624,Knowledge of full baseball stadium capacity vs. size of sections shown in image.
479,Tried to count people a square area then multiply this number for the whole image.  Estimated guess. 
85,I looked at the picture and thought about what stadiums have I thought of a number from that
26,I thought there might be 100 people in every 2 rows or so.
1365,"take a segment in the foreground to assess how much an area of 100 people would cover, then extrapolate to the entire frame"
485,estimated by counting first 100 people and then guessed the remainer
256,Roughly counted the amount of people placed vertically in a row and then the number of people placed horizontally in a row and multiplied the numbers together
597,"I counted a group of people with my mind from the bottom corner. I looked at the size of the group , a circular size and then counted the groups from there using the patch that I had guessed was about a 100 people."
1107,"I thought about counting the blue dots, but decided just to guess"
142,I counted 60 people per row and then the approximate number of rows gave me 24
480,"I read the instructions, observed the image, tried to divide the crowd in smaller groups to estimate how many people were in that group and then calculated for the overall group of people. "
1220,"looking at it as blocks of 20 people per row, 5 rows per block at best guess that would be around 1,800 people in that picture"
1371,worked out how much space 10 people took up. Woked out how wide a slice for 100 and added up how many 100s I thought there might be
632,I just did a rough estimate I tried counting one row to see how many but it was hard to keep track of how many and to count each individual dot
1636,I looked at a picture of a crowd and was asked to guess the number of people in it
755,I made a guess based on the amount of people in the picture. I visualised what different amounts of people would look like. This is how I came by my answer.
169,"counted 10 people across at bottom tier and top tier, counted around 25 tiers. Estimated this section at 250 people, then extrapolated."
1536,I basically looked at the image took a rough estimate and times it as all is a blur.
1868,I counted around 50 people and then tried to work off that so that 50 became 100 and then filled the full picture
1383,"I used my gut to be honest, I guessed and used a short vision in order to imagine approximately the crowd "
364,"tried to quarter the pic, 8th it but in the end i thought of a sports stadium and guessed around 5000"
1685,That is my best guess
1357,"i started counting the row but then my eyes went fuzzy. having been to a stadium, i know they can fil in lots of people and it looks like more that 500 individuals but not more than 1000 so i picked a ranom number between that"
5,"counting the amount of people in one of the middle rows, then multiplying by the amount of rows (including half rows)"
1816,I thought of my general knowledge of stadiums and their capacities.
310,"It looked like a stadium that I've been for a concert, and it was packed. Looked like a large number of people and the section was full."
1758,I compared the size of the stadium in the image to my university classroom and saw its maybe 3x bigger.
1533,Tried to group the people and estimate the number of people in each group and then multiply that number.
912,i was doing my stuff when i heard a notification from prolific. that's how i found out and began this task.
175,vibes.
1708,"Focusing on a les dense area of the picture. Not clean counting the blue dots. Extrapolating the area for a smaller chunk of the picture, having real life dimensions in mind. Extrapolating this chunk to whole picture, correcting upwards for dense blue spot areas."
51,Based on the blue dots in every row multiplied by the number of seats in each section.
1205,Size of a football ground guess the gate then divvy up a section so seemed about 3000
546,"I counted a small sample and approximated. For example, i would could 20 in one sample and see the percentage of the entire picture that it covers, i did it again somehwere else and coutned 50 and similarly saw the percentage that covers the pictuer"
939,"Try to generalize areas (by 100) the count tally them up, I saw 8 =800  + 50 for a rough estimate."
1277,"I tried to imagine the event and how many people there could be there. Additionally, I tried to count some of them and try to multiply"" them"""
153,I made a rough guess of the number of full rows and partial rows. Then made a guess at the number in each row. I then multiplied these two numbers together.
999,Counted how many people were in the rows then counted the rows
146,Zoomed in and roughly counted the smaller area then guessed how many of those sections fitted in the picture 
1300,I tried to count a row and then multiply but ended up just guessing at the end 
98,Counted one row and then estimated how many rows
1191,I figured it out based on previous concerts Iâve been to and the amount seemed about the same in the concerts Iâve been to
1894,"I counted roughly how many were is a small area and multiplied up, taking perspective into account. "
1627,Divide a line and multiply 
1876,"Generally a football stadium holds thousands of people, so so took a wild guess "
1070,Well I did try to count the visible audiences at first than I guessed the number of other audiences 
1207,Scanned rows and sections. Estimated numbers in blocks.
1094,"Roughly estimated. Went up in increments, adding a zero to the end of the number. Found the closest to my method."
1676,i just assumed a number - wasn't much calculation but it seemed very dense
351,"I started counting the dots in the areas where they were most present, therefore at the top. Since counting them one by one was a bit utopian, I took the quantity present in a given area and then added it area by area like squares, imagining the probability that there would be more or less the same quantity."
456,multiply the number of people
542,looked like .25 of the picture contained about 100 people
1166,I thought back to a time when I was in a football (soccer to you!) crowd. I was thinking in particular of a match where 3000 attended and this photo seemed a similar size of crowd.
897,"I tried to count the people from left and right, and then from top to bottom"
1767,estimated by visual sense
1116,Teated to count but ...guessed by gutfeeling.
642,I took a guesstimate 
1350,I counted ten people and from those ten people I got to one hundred people.  I then counted in hundreds.
568,"I counted about a dozen to see how much space"" they took up on the picture. I then tried my best to use that to visually multiply it for an estimate."""
758,"I tried to count people up the rows and across and multiply it, but a lot of the people were hard to count so i don't think it went that well."
254,i took a section of people and estimated the number then multiplied by how big the area was
816,I was assuming the number of people in the picture. 
984,I estimated the amount of rows and the number of people per row. I then multiplied them together to get to a rough estimate and whether I thought it was sensible based on sporting events I have been to.
1474,i tried to see how many where in a square of the picture and try guess how many square i could fit in the picture
1470,"Didn't use any particular strategy, I just used my gut feeling and estimated."
1355,Just tried to get a feel of how many people there were.
46,"It was mostly a guess, although I tried to think of a time I've been in a crowd of around 1000 to estimate what that looked like"
751,A complete guess because itâs too hard to count that many people
661,"I split the picture up into 4 sections, I assumed that some crowded sections had up to 150 people and some less crowded sections had around 80, it averaged out to around 400 people."
1781,I tried to visualise how many people could fit in a stadium.
1323,I tried to roughly count. It was based on estimating. Trying to group numbers together. 
1501,I counted a section then multiplied by the number of sections I thought there was. 
842,"calculating how a group of ten people look, and distributing that through the photo. "
12,instictivley guestimating based of senses
1461,my old church sat 500 people.  This looks like a larger crowd then that
596,Try to guess how many people are in a row roughly and then times how many rows are there. 
715,"Firstly I was thinking about the capacity of a stadium, then I noticed that the picture looks more like a school hall than a stadium so I decided to use the capacity of a school hall. A schoolâs hall(that is as big as the picture)capacity is roughly about 5000-10 000 people."
1448,I took a small portion of the image and counted how many were there. Then I looked at how many portions would fit on the entire image. THen I introduced the factor that as the distance icnreases more people are fit inside the same patch. I then rounded up and gave an estimate random 2 diits number. I believe answer is between 1200-1500
567,made groups of 100 people and conted them
1022,"First I counted a single collum of people, then multiplied that by an estimate of the number of rows in the bottom section. I then multiplied that by two to account for the top section, then went to the nearest hundred."
1821,Tried to count the people on the lower part of the photo and then multiply whith the width the higher up you go
1396,used a full football stadium for reference and then decided on what percentage of a stadium was in this picture

868,count the heads in one row and then multiply by the amount of rows i can count
167,Times a rough amount of rows by rows 
607,I just guessed it by looking at one line in the middle.
1394,Previous experience of trying to assess crowds and the number normally being higher than it looks.
1341,"I divided the picture into two parts, the upper part counts how many rows there are, counts the number of people in each row and adds them together, the lower part counts the left part first, then the right part, and finally adds all of them together."

919,Just basic view 
1017,Tried to look at how many dots within one small area and make judgement on how many groups I would think could be 
1732,Made a loose count from the first couple of rows. I then estimated the total number of rows and multiplied it.
274,"I counted how many in half a row, then doubled & then times by the number of rows. I then added an extra 300 on top."
788,I tried counting how many people woyld be in a row by head count of the blue dot
1679,I tried to put the crowd into sections of 10 then blocks of a 100 to obtain a rough estimate
1778,"I counted 25 in one row, then tried to estimate how many people were in the whole row. Then estimated how much rows there were and multiplied it."
1435,I counted the number of blue dots in a couple of areas and then guessed
1302,Looked at a small section and then multiplied it
866,"I briefly estimated how many people were in one row, and how many rows there were"
1276,"Roughly estimated a hundred people, by groups of ten. Then estimated how many hundreds."
648,I think for me it was just a guess. I knew counting was too time consuming so I tried to imagine how much of a portion of a stadium would hold and guessed
1634,I imagined the capacity of a theatre I gave performed in several times and mentally compared the image to that
743,I looked at all the dots and thought about how many people might fit in to a stadium and tried to guess by that 
1480,"Counted two small area, one densly populated, the other not so. Then tried to envisage how many square of each type I could make. Put the two together  to hopefully get an answer close to the number."
1424,I scanned the photo. I then roughly estimated 10 people and kept multiplying by 10. I multiplied this across every section of the photo.
1123,Tried to count roughly how many people are in a single row then multiplied it by the amount of rows. 
1841,"I made a quick visual estimate, without thinking much further."
1248,I literally just tried to sort out a number

1703,Not much
278,Count the number of 10 blue heads from the lower right hand side. Using this size and estimate the remaining of the blÃ© heads.
639,I counted (roughly) how many people were in each row and each column and multiplied the two numbers together. I tried to get a rough average for row and column length by counting somewhere near the middle of the image.
192,I counted up the number of blue blobs along one row and then counted the number of rows and multiplied the two together.  That was for the first block and then I did the same for the higher block
251,I roughly estimated the number of people in a section of the photo then multiplied that by the number of sections in the photo.

1777,"I looked at closely and started to try and count.  Then i thought this isn't gonna work, Then 20,000 just popped into my head"
1039,"I noticed that it is a stadium, or rather a part of it. Considering how much capacity the whole stadium might have, I tried to estimate the number, based on the section in question."
207,Just a rough estimate

1694,counted the number in a small section then guess how many sections
730,"First i tried to count the average number of people per row, and then I counted the rows and I did a simple multiplication. I also tried to do groups of every 100 dots to calculate the total."
438,I roughly counted up the number of the rows in the front left of the picture.  Then I just guessed the rest.

1586,"It looks like part of a stadium and when full that could be 50,000 strong"
1752,To be honest i couldn't understand why did you ask for this task as it needed to choose random number so i gave random number as i tried to count but pic wasn't clear.
768,I selected an arbitrary row of people in the picture and counted about 10 people per row. I then counted the about 10 rows per section of 10 people. I counted 20 sections and took 10 * 10 * 20 and added 200 because I think I may have underestimated.
279,Looked a the number of blue blobs\; at first thought it was several thousand then  re-estimated
150,it was a complete guess
631,"I had to estimate the number since it's not an easy task to count all of them 1 by 1. When I came up with that number I had to assume these people were in stadium, and as we know that stadiums carry a certain capacity, I had to conclude this portion being people occupying that number of seats in a stadium."

135,"Counted ~10 and estimated the area of 100 people, and then counted the # of the area of 100 people"
145,experience and a quick gander
861,"I just guessed on my experience of being crowds and what I heard the attendance to be, "
216,I counted one row and then tried to count the columns.
1389,I just looked at each row and thought peobably 80 to 100.  I didn't try to count.  I always under estimate in counting tasks i.e guess the number of sweets in a jar competiotions so also added more than I zctually thought there are.
867,"Since the people appeared to be evenly distributed in the picture, I split the screen up into sections. I then counted roughly the amount of people in that section, and multiplied it by the number of sections I had split the screen up into; in this case 12. Don't ask me why 12, when 10 would have been easier.  Anyhow, that's how I did it; I split the screen into 12, roughly counted the number in the twelfth, then multiplied that number."
35,I roughly counted a row of people. Then I estimated how many 'rows there would be.

61,I just gave a random opinion
1112,"Determining how many people can fit into 1 row, multiply it by number of rows. Since the back rows than the front ones I assumed it will balance itslef."
1082,"I counted roughly how many people are in a row, and then counted how many people are roughly in a column and multiplied that by itself"
1615,i just looked at the picture and estimated 
916,Roughly count 1 row and then roughly multiply by how many rows there seem to be
1803,"Estimated how many groups of 10, then groups of 100."
1605,"I've looked at the row that has the most people, counted blue points on it, then counted blue points on the one least visible, added together, multiplied by 2 and rounded to a closest hundred (300). So basically a bunch of random math I thought may be smart, but is probably stupid and nonsencial lol."
1607,I made a guess between 200 and 300
38,"Try to count heads in 1cmx1cm, then guess total area"
149,I first estimated the people in one row (20) and them the number of rows (20). I multiplied these numbers together then increased it slightly as the top rows have more people in them.

64,I looked at a picture with a lot of people and guessed how many there were 
1490,guessed
657,I looked how much space approx 10 people took. Then guessed how many of those spaces there were in the picture and rounded it up.
1540,I tried to gauge how many people could be in one row and how many rows there were. Then gave up on reasoning logically and just guessed
1543,"I said a row was about 50 people, so two were about 100. then counted by hundreds in lower bowl, and counted by ~150s in upper bowl bc it was more crowded."
992,I had to guess the number of people in the picture.
1289,I grouped them into roughly what i think is 500 and then calculated how many 500's i could see. I then multiplied them together to get to the estimated number.
1320,"I counted a small portion of the crowd, and times it by roughly how many of those squares of 10 I saw"
1601,It looks like a big crowd so I just guessed.
37,Tried to estimate how many people would fit into my local stadium and divide that.
801,"Roughly counted a group of 10 in one corner, then counted across and down the same space, multiplied the two and rounded it."
178,I tried to zoom in on the photograph to get a better view. I visualized what a group of 10-20 people appeared to be on the screen and gave my best estimate. The blue dots also served as a rough guide for me.
904,"All I really did was give an estimate of how many people I think are in the picture, it looks as though there is a good thousand but not sure how much exactly "
1570,I try to look at every row 
29,"I tried to count the number of rows and how many people are in one. I used that to estimate, but it is not an exact method, it was more about guessing."
518,Tried to count the approximate number of people across the rows and down in columns - multiplied one figure by another - one for the bottom section and one for the top
507,Did a rough estimate of number of people in a row and then counted back. Didn't do any specific equations but tried to get a ballpark using this method.
1834,I thought about a stadium or a concert seating arrangement and thought about the space and how approx how much seats were there and compared it to the photo.
924,"I roughly counted the number of rows in the picture, then approximated the number of people in a row somewhere in the middle. Then, I simply multiplied the numbers."
785,I estimated based on the number of people I see. 
636,I briefly counted how many people were in each row and how many rows each stand had
1512,"Made an imaginary grid. Counted the number of people in one part, then multiplied by the rest of the grid. I added some as I started at the bottom and the top looked more populated. "
317,I counted across how many people in a single row and multiplied by the amount of rows of seats i saw
957,I counted the number of blue dots in a section and just figured about how many sections there were and came to my answer.
1830,i just did a rough head count on the bottom section and just guestimate that amount x2.5 for the top rows
1660,I tried to count how many people are in one line and then estimate the number.
371,I imagine a random game of football where the stands are full. My closest arena takes 35.000 people and that picture looked like a small part of a arena.
588,i counted a couple of rows and tried to x them

396,I tried to roughly count the people along the x and y axes and multiplied it. It also looked about right for that part of a stadium.
334,Random estimate (Iâm not good with numbers) I attempted to roughly count the rows both ways 
682,"Mainly counted a small number of those blue dots to somewhat deduce how many people there could be in the stadium. As I've often realized that sometimes it may appear too small or too big, best strategy I came up with was to just seize a small sample and make an approximation."
361,"I counted 1 row in the middle, then I multiplied by a guesstimate of rows, knowing some would be shorter and some would be longer."
594,"Based on Eden Park Stadium, Auckland, which seats 50000, the image is about one-fifth of the seating area.   Therefore, 10.000 is the response."
740,"First, I counted 10 people, and then I basically rounded up a group of people to the amount of 100. With that in mind, I just started counting the people with the size of the group I counted as 100"""
1337,just a guesstimate from gig experience
414,I counted a bit and then gave my best estimate.
947,Just imagine 
166,I estimated total number of rows and approximately persons per row.
1199,i looked at a row and saw that I was able to see individual heads. This meant the number is not gonna be above 500 as i could only see some of the crowd in the photo.
1430,Just by estamating how many people i think would be in each row.
1438,"I counted out ten people to find out roughly how big a space ten people took up, then used that to figure out roughly the space 100 people took up, then counted how many of those size spaces were in the photo."
641,I grouped together what I thought looked like 100 people and scanned the entire photo to see how many groups fit.
180,"I tried to count the number of heads from left to right, then up and down. Then i multiplied the two numbers together in order to extrapolate the information."
1514,Well I started to do a grid calculation and figure how many in each grid size of my choice then guessed from there.
1537,I just guessed
229,Waiting a little bit for coming studies on my phone while I am sitting
1119,"how counts the heads of 10 people in a single row, then guessed length of it and tried to see how many 10 their were in a line, then tried the predict how many rows their were of people and made a guess of that"
1602,Looked atvthe amount of dots an roughly worked out in lines howany people i thought
1724,"Counted sections, made an estimate of how many rows visible, and then estimated how many people in each row. And added another 20% or so for good measure because I was pretty sure I was still underestimating."
885,i sort of counted how many people were in a smaller block then multiplied that by a factor of ten
1825,estimation through stadium capacities as a point of reference
1820,"I first tried to estimate how many people were in each row, and then multiplied by the quantity of rows."
1224,"Counted approximately the number of people in a single row, and multiplied by an estimate of the total number of rows "
453,I took a guess of how much area can contain 1000 people then added more area according to my calculations.
638,"I assumed each section had about 100 people, and there looked to be about 10+ sections"
716,I thought about how many people can fit in a stadium and how many people can fit specifically into a section of stands. 
1392,"I looked at the pic for a while and counted dots. Then I realised that was ridiculous, so instead I counted out a line of 10 dots, then used the size of that to estimate how many people were in a row (length of line of 10 vs length of line total) then I guessed how many rows were in the picture and multiplied them together"
820,"Initially, I counted how many people I could see in a small section of the image, then tried multiplying that by the number of similar sized sections it would take to cover the entire image. My arithmetic skills weren't up to the task, so I ended up simply guessing."
1353,"I estimated that there are about 30 rows of seats and noticed that this is probably a stadion where soccer is played. I know how many seats does PogoÅ szczecin's stadion have (around 28000), so I calculated that this is about 1/10 of full circle. Pogon's stadions have around 20 rows of seats, so i arounded that to 7000 persons"
551,I tried counting row by row. I might have missed a lot but I was counting how many blue dots I saw.
1156,"I tried to count the blue dots in one row, about in the middle. There seemed to be about 75. Then I counted the # rows. There seemded about 26. So 75 x 26 = approx 1950"
925,I tried to estimate a rough portion of it and then used that as a measure to estimate the rest
1643,How many blue dots under fingertip. Roughly how many fingertips along and up to get area. Multiplied three figures and added a few on top
1789,I looked at the top right hand corner in detail and counted the hats.  I then used that information to estimate how many poeple where in the picture.
687,"Very roughly counted the number of rows and even more roughly guessed how many people visible in each row. Not very easy, since they are more distant on the right. Very low confidence in my guess."
1563,I tried to focus on how many peoples were there and guess the number
1175,First I had a guess based on travelling to football stadiums and being roughly able to estimate the travelling supporters or a full stand of supporters. I estimated just over 5000. I then tired to look at a small section with the aim of extrapolating but this wasn't successful. I then took a screenshot and went to Chatgpt and asked it to calculte the number or of people. It wasn't able. Therefore I inputted my original estimate.
1707,I estimated the capacity of a stadium and assumed that this part of the stadium can hold at least 800 people.
328,I took a guess on how many people were in a row and then how many rows there were. It was done quickly and was a guess
1068,"I did a quick count of helmets that comprised a hundred. Then I estimated about how many of that size could be seen over distances and totaled them. However, the parameters of where the crowd began or ended was unclear."
1775,Scanned the area. Counted how many per one row and roughly guessed how many rows there were. Multiplied them
302,"I tryed to guess how many people in one roll and one column, and multiple this values for the final guess value."
676,I counted 10 blue circles so I could see what amount of space that took up. Then I tried to image how many groups of 10 could fit in the photo.
1356,I looked at the rows and counted an average amount of people per row. 
1167,"I tried to calculate how many people were in each row, then I multiplied by the number of rows. I fear I probably underestimated the number. "
1351,i just quickly checked the image and decided
1407,I was looking at the amount of people and was trying to figure out how many people would normally be at a football game normally. also was trying to  rough amount of the people
1812,i gueesed
811,I took a guess based in the average size of stadiums around the world.
290,Mostly just a gut feeling based on the average arena size that I have seen. Tried counting a bit but that was pointless to me.
1338,"Approx 100 people in a row (full), and then count up vertically! Crowds always seem fewer than there are in shots like this"
1471,"First estimate how many people in a row, then more or less see how many rows per sections and finally sum them up. I tried to account for different densities in different sections."
484,"I counted the rows in the foreground, estimated the width and the added double that for the top section "
878,I roughly counted the number of people in one portion and multiplied it - this was roughly done rather than precisely.
8,Try to see how many rows are there in one section. And there are two sections. Something like that. 
1617,"I just tried to look closer, in order to understand how many people actually are, as the dots are thousands and tiny, compared to thr picture. So, I thought it could be around 1000 people."
540, very quick estimate of rows across and down and then basically just guesswork
798,counted the middle row which I determined to be the longest row of individuals then counted the number of rows and multiplied the number and reduced it by a 10% due to the row narrowing near the bottom
660,I used my thumb as a measure and gave a specific value of people to 1 thumb
944,Compared to size of a football stadium and what an average amount for a tier
872,Multiplying verticals and horizontal counts of the blue dots or human faces I saw in the line 
1663,estimated the number of people in a vertical and horizontal row and multiplied the two numbers.
472,Just guessed
1109,Looked across horizontally and down vertically and then just surmised
1190,I picked out what i thought were 10 people. Then repeated that block of size across the picture to get to a final number
890,Just a guess if the proportion of a big stadium 
226,"I estimated how many people might be in a small, square section. I thing estimated the area of the picture (length x width) in units of that small square, and multiplied them together."
590,When I was in school we had 500 students and the assemblies were about that size.
1582,I counted a small section of people and then counted the number of sections that were approximately the same size and then multiplied those numbers.
1241,"i know how the capacity of a stadium, and i just used instinct to guess"
1441,I tried to count 20 people and than compeared that are to the full picture and calculate a full number.
1609,"The image looks like it was taken in a stadium, so I thought about the average max capacity of stadium seating. Then, I examined the image to get an estimate on how big of a section of the stadium was visible, and how many people might be there."
1212,I sectioned up the picture and estimated how many people were in each section 
1215,Counted 10 people to see the general size that would be and then guessed how many would fill the square.
473,I counted a few rows across and tried to multiply that by how many rows there were and then i approximated it from that. 
1840,I estimated how many people were in the crowd 
1534,"i looked at an area and it's size, estimated the amount of people there and then estimated the amount of such areas in the picture"
882,"Estimate the number of people in one row and try to sort out how many rows. Then, multiple both numbers"
502,"Sort of just an estimate of what I'd expect, I'm very bad at these sort of things. I didn't exactly count but there is a high density of people in the back so I decided to shoot fairly high with the guess."
452,counted along the top line then counted down the side and then times by each. this allowing that they are in lines should give a rough answer.
528,I did my best to count the number of people one of the rows of seats
879,I assigned a section to how many people can be there and then added more section accordingly to add people 
47,judged it v football crowd capacity
1874,I just guessed
1090,It was just a guess. The people in the photo are tiny so it's difficult to gauge. 
1431,"counted across the middle as a guess, then up and down, multiplied   then added so,e on. "
824,Counted a small area and estimated a multiple of that
608,I regularly visit a relatively large football stadium. I used my understanding of this ground to come to this estimate. 
625,I just tried to look at how many sections of the photo looked like they contained a hundred people and then kind of made an approximate guess as to how many sections the photo would make up. 
1178,Look at the photo and tried  see hiw nany people  are in the  photo 
1748,I just did some visual estimate
1152,I roughly counted 10 people and made a guess based on that
199,I started counting a middle row and counted about 50. The started counting how many rows might be. Then took an educated guess based on this.
946,I just assumed how many people are in one row then counted the number of rows
1016,I tried to determine the amount of people in the photo.
1380,"i count the dots on the vertical and horizontal line on the edge of the image, and then by doing the multiply operation I estimate it should be twice the quantity"
99,"i thought in my head how many seats are in each row, estimate how many rows there are, and determine the general capacity of the space within the image to take an estimated guess. I rounded up to give a estimated number."
717,"I tried to remember a certain amount of people I've seen recently and knew the number of, and tried to determine how many more were in this picture. "
530,Just a rough guess based on previous experience of watching sports on tv.  This looks like one corner of an arena that could typically have this amount of people. 
1595,I counted a small square of dots and multiplied them to fill the whole image
604,i estimated how much people was on a small square and then multiplied
1718,I counted ten rows of ten and estimated what that looked like and then estimated how many groups of that size were in the room.
852,Roughly 20 people in a line. Roughly 50 lines. I'm pretty sure i've underestimated.
1741,"I didn't really use any technique, I just estimated it."
618,I thought about a sporting event i go to and how many people attend that. I then estimated how many of them would fit in that section of the stadium in the picture.
728,"I tried to count the rows of blue dots (faces), estimated 15 at the front and same at the back.  Then I estimated how many in each row and multiplied the figures."
463,I looked from top to bottom and made an estimate
941,Because you can see by the way the stadium is packed up
1196,Counted a small area then made an overall guess
147,"I looked at the size of the rows and estimated the size of the row and then compared it to the other rows, looked at he rest and made an assumption"
1077,"I counted one row of people, roughly, across, and then counted one row of people down. Multiplied the across by the down."
1104,So I had to look at the photo and estimate how many +- people were in it. I wrote 2000
739,It was a guess based on what I could see
291,I thought of my old school assembly and how many people used to be there and the compare the difference 
1345,I guessed at how much room 10 people took.  Then I made a rough guess as to how many 10 people sections there are.
265,It was just a pure guess. It looks like some sort of sports stadium. I am not a sports fan therefore it is a pure guess.
526,I lookied at one slice of the pictures and tried to count the blue dots. Then devided the image into those slices and multiplied the number to gte the total
1491,"I counted 25 blue dots in each of the top and bottom sections, taking a vertical sample, then I visually expanded that group 3 more times next to the first sample, so I had an idea of what a block of 100 looked like, then I estimated how many of those were in the top section and bottom section, and came up with roughly 800 in each section."
988,I think it a quarter of an arena
1408,I tried to work out what percentage of the picture had 100 people in it and thought it was roughly one line of the bottom of the picture then I thought a thousand people would be about a tenth of the picture. I added on another hundred or so for luck.
1682,"assuming theres about 20 seats per row thats seen, i guestimated from that"
1500,I estimated the number of people based on the size of the stadium.
62,I looked at the venue and it looked like a big event that averaged about over 1000 people
327,thought it was about 50-100 per section then counted the sections
1111,I just guessed 
1735,"First I tried to observe the image as much as possible from different perspectives, from afar and closer and then I tried to estimate how many people there were in one part of the image and after thinking about that part I tried to mentally calculate how many there were in total, being just a guess obviously."
1047,i didnt really have a strategy i guess i counted 1 row which came up about 50 and then guess there is about 30-50 in each row
1727,"counted 10 people across, roughly counted the rows in each block of 10 (80), rounded up to 100 and counted each section that looked like 100"
849,Just tried to guess
1065,"I counted roughly what 10 people looked like, multiplied by the number of rows i could see. Then rounded up a bit since there was more outside the edges of the picture"
1131,Looked at the capacity of the area
628,"Roughly calculated approximately 100 blue dots, then how many clusters of a similar amount there were"
486,"Counted about how many people seemed to be in a row, and how many rows there might be"
1499,I counted both rows and people in one row and multiplied them 
1530,Used what I know about soccer stadiums and figured it was a small section of a stand so could be around 2000.
1838,"I tried to divide the people in two groups: people who were at the top and people who were at the bottom. By looking at the bottom, I estimated that there were 200 people. Then I multiplied it for two because the group that was at the top looked similar in amount."
1826,"I looked at the image and guessed based on the scale of the environment, and how many blue dots I could quickly tot up"
1592,In the bottom rew i counted 5 people and how much space they occupied. counted how many groups there were from loft to right and estimated the hight of the group. Counted the amount of groups from the bottom to the top and multiplied both findings. Compensated fot thr rows getting wider to the top and came up with a very rough estimate that from left to right
1624,Super quick count of top row and bottom row and the guesstimate of how many rows there might be.
1298,I tried to picture what 100 people would look like in the image and then multiplied by 12 which is the number of groups across the whole image.
905,I just guessed a number as it was difficult to calculate. I could say that I tried to estimate based on my experience as a security officer.
333,i just focus one row first and then calculate it like i take one row as 100 then multiple the size and other rows
1381,"i tried to visualize the number of people in a horizontal line, then vertically, and kinda multiplied to estimate a number"
1556,Counted a single line of dots from the top then roughly multiplied it by how many columns
651,"I estimated the count by counting 50 people per section,"
1367,I tried to estimate the amount of people in a roe and then calculate how many rows there were 
1089,I compared it to the size of my local soccer team's stadium at maximum capacity and segregated the amount of people of one section only
1231,"I started in one corner, counting roughly how many people were in that area, then mentally copied and pasted that section onto other parts of the image, counting how many times it went in, then multiplied the original estimate (of 100) accordingly"
1322,At first I tried to count a small part and then see how many of those parts I could fit in the screen but this turned to be impossible. After that I guessed using only my luck since I can't be sure no matter what I do in such a big scale.
881,"Roughly counted the number of people in one row, then multiplied that by the approximate number of rows that I could distinguish"
1221,I thought of how many people used to be in my school assembly 
1831,"I looked at the density of the dots in a couple areas, chose a square size, roughly counted how many squares, and then multiplied that by the dots. Some areas were more dense than others. I then added a bit more to my number because it felt low "
270,"count a column of people , count a row of people, multiply"
591,"I tried to look at the overall picture to start with to try and get an idea. When l looked at the picture l totally overestimated the amount of people in the picture. I had to look at the picture a number of times to get a more accurate amount, hopefully!"
1145,counting the rows and this wide. then rounding up 
876,Tried to count a small number and see how many of those groups I thought made up the larger photo. 
1686,Mainly it was estimation but I also did try to count how many rows there where
1249,Take a certain number of people and then calculate that number by area. When I did the sum I had a total of people.
42,from when i go to a football match 
318,I estimated around 100 - 200 people for each row
392,I tried to count the top row and then I came down and counted rows across that looked roughly similar and then adjusted the rows nearer to the bottom to a smaller amount - conscious that there were fewer people as the images were closer. I tried to consider that the angle of the photograph meant that there wouldn't be the same amount of people in the rows that I was counting.
1008,"I looked at the frame of the picture and I recognise that this venue is packed. So I just assumed a 20,000 capacity and estimated this was 1/4 of the venue. That would've been 5000 people but I didn't think there were that many so I decrease my estimation to 3500."
294,i j=guessed what it was
1482,I guessed the bottom row of people had about 300-400 people so the top row would be equal or more
1818,I roughly counted the number of people in a row in the middle and multiplied it by an estimate of the number of columns.
465,"The average hockey arena I would guess fits about 18,000 people. I guessed the photo could wrap around a hockey rink 6 times which equals 12,000 people. Then 6,000 people would be in the upper levels."
559,"Roughly guessed how many would be in a specific spot (like 1/5) of the screen, then timesd that by 5 for the total"
1238,I estimated that based on one square in the lower right corner there are about 20 people. I estimated that such squares fit about 50 in the picture. I multiplied and I think there are about 980 people.
497,"Too much people to count in less than three minutes, so I counted to 10 in an area and estimated the total based on how much people I percieved."
1801,"I first counted a group of 10 and saw how much space roughly 10 people take up, then counted how many groups of 10 fit length and width wise in the image, then multipled the two and rounded up."
331,Counted a few sections and then multiplied. 
308,I counted a small sample area and then guessed based on the size of the overall picture how many blue dots there would be based on my sample area.
264,I just looked at the picture like instructed and from there entered an estimate of the people of which I thought were there in the picture. Thank you.
1858,I divided the crowd into three squares and guessed the lengths of each square. I determined there was 600 people per square. Three squares of 600 people each equals 1800 people.
1689,Started counting then just completely guessed
1699,I estimated the number of people based on how many rows I saw. 
288,I just remembered a photo of my team's stadium with similar crowd and they were 3000
53,tried to get the average amount per little square then just multiplied it
759,Based off seating and crowdedness I made a judgement
488,I based my number on previous times I have seen crowds similar to this size. I also based my number on it being not too large (thousands) and not too small (less than 100 people) so that it would be generally accurate.
287,I made a guess based on the number of rows. I figured that the number would be less than 10 thousand but higher than 5 so I guessed 8.
970,I tried to picture a similar venue and took a guess in that ballpark!
103,I have no clue. I am very bad at guessing like this. 
1569,i tried counting but felt like it is futile so i based my answer on my already known counted number
1069,Roughly tried to count the people in the row up and across then multipled the numbers
1814,I made an approximate guess on the amount of seats a small or mid-sized stadium would have then made my guess; assuming that this is just a small section and a general lookover.
236,"I counted the blue hats in a determined area. That is, I counted the people in an are that was not the emptiest or fullest, than calulated how many of those squares fit in the image and multiplied."
722,"I first counted the rows, which were about 10. Then, I checked out the whole picture, and felt it was 10 x 100."
1165,looked at how many people appeared to be in a row and then multiplied by number of rows
523,I groped them into units of about 10 and guessed how many horizontal and vertical
1799,I estimated how much a stadium can accommodate people
930,Thought about a football stadium I go to and thought of average crowd and tried to visualise that section. 
1195,I tried counting the numbers of rows and how many people could sit. I also compared to previous events where I saw a similar number oof people.
1013,Imagined how many people in each row 
835,estimate the number of people in a photo
1163,I estimated a row and number of rows.
1066,I estimated how many people I thought were in the crowd
1510,I thought about a football match and guest my estimation from this. 
869,I scanned across a row of people and counted them up. I then went down and counted how many rows there were and estimated up.
1083,"I just tried to count the number of people based on the number of people on right side of the picture multiplied by the number of people on the upper side. I didn't count the exact number, so it's just an estimate."
1352,I looked at the number of blue dots in the cornor and got an estimate. I then treated it as two seperate areas and got an estimate. I then added to two areas (the dividers in the stand) and added them together.
613,I roughly counted a small section and estimated the rest based on that
1764,Looked at the blue dots. Tried to think of it extrapolated. A bit of abstract thought/gut/intuition.
1374,I counted 50 dots and extrapolated from the area it represented.
1524,I counted small portion of the crowd and estimated what the whole number could be
188,"I just tried to imagine how big a crowd of 100, 200...500, 600 people would look, and tried to see if I could believe the number I guessed."
1114,I tried to count one row and then multiply it but I lost count; so I just guessed!
937,Roughly scanned the image to determine how many people are there
1262,I calculate what area had 50 people and then compared that size with the rest of the stadium
210,Best guess 
467,"I picked a row of a section and estimated 20 people, grew the number based on section and then added all sections as if they were about 100 each and rounded up to 1000."
1346,I tried to imagine a football stadium I am familiar with and know the capacity of then base my estimate on that 
384,had a look at how many were in a row and estimated based off scale 
1458,I guessed roughly how much of a section would be 1000 people and then decided the rest of the crowd.
418,"I divided the picture to two halfs. The top part which is more dense than the lower part. Then I divided the top half into 10 rows and 20 colums. The Icounted how many blue dots/cell to find the number of blue dots in the top half of the picture. I repated the same method in the lower half of the picture. To estimate thre total number of people, I added the two numbers."
471,rough count of the rows  approximate by length eye balled comparable to rows  then times them 
269,Just took a guess. Counted the amount of people by size of stadium. 
907,took a wild guess at how many people there could be based on the amount of blue dots (presuming that the blue dots represented each person)
1870,I tried to count the top row. Then the row on the edge going down. I then multiplied them togeter and rounded it of to the next biggest number.
1135,"I imagined my own favourite sports teams own stadium. This holds 60,000 supporters. I tried to picture the people inside my teams stadium and what percentage of the stands they would use up."
685,"Started counting small section, realised I couldnât scale and then completely guessed"
408,Simply made an educated guess as I thought counting and estimating wouldnât work since the rows arenât all visible from the camera angle 
1251,"I counted the amount of people sitting in one row of one block and then counted the amount of visible rows, after which i added a rough amount more to compensate for the half rows in the back"
266,"It was a complete guess, based on a general sample size from a vague area of people, that I then applied across the entire picture. I counted ten people, then figured that amount would fit in there about 100 times."
1053,I counted 10 people and made a quick estimate around the amount of groups of 10 I could see. I was more generous as the blobs of people were greater to the far end of the image.
54,"I tried to work out roughly how much space 10 people took up and then tried to work out how many groups of 10 and 100 there might be,"
250,i counted how manye where in a row and many rows i could see
1693,"I focused on the first couple of rows, guestimated the number of people in those roles and then multiplied by the general amount of rows."
1494,"I counted a row of people and then estimated how many rows, multiplied that together. I also decided to increase the amount of people just because it felt right."
1336,I counted out a certain amount of people in one section and then tried to estimate how many sections of that size there were.
1036,I tried to count the number of dots vertically and horizontally. Multiplied it and rounded it off.
548,I tried to count approximately the biggest row (I counted about 62 people) and counted how many rows (about 40) so I multiplied the two numbers and add some people that could be standing up
1852,"I just guessed based on some TV programs that I have watched and the organizers say what the number of their participants were. So sometimes, a crowd like this can be up to what I quoted."
918,quick estimation
1652,I guessed
1835,I was shown a picture of a stadium and asked to guess how many people were in the photo.
1805,Quickly scanned over whilst roughly adding up as I went along 
812,Approximately 50 in a row and then guessed from there.
1666,"Divided the area into 100 rectangles, then estimate the amount of people in one rectangle, the multiply this by 100"
1698,I tried to focus on the row and how many blue dot there were
1504,"I tried to count the dots in each row, then tried to work out how many rows there are, before multiplying the numbers together and adding 500 as I believe I underestimated it slightly originally."
1216,I tried to imagine how many people could fit in a row and then multiplied by the number of rows
1286,I tried to count the crowd at the top of the picture. After reaching about 20 people I estimated how many more were in the top half based on how much space they took up. I did the same with the bottom half.
190,"I just made a guess, nothing specific."
533,I just looked around and thoughht 1000
669,Counted a small square in the lower left and then tried to fill that picture with the squares and took square number x people in that square
1487,Counted amount of people across multiple by the amount of rows minus a few
1483,"The area of the picture, the rough calculation by square metre of oeople, plus those i can really count"
160,I just guessed based on the nearest hundred i thought there was
1472,"I kind of just counted a row to see what the esimate of people there would be, then did some math then i kind of just guessed"
719,First I tried to count the rows and how many people in each row to estimate how many people there were in total in the photo
309,counted roughly how many in a section and then a rough guess of the amount of sections
425,"Identified a small square, counted roughly 20 within it.  I then counted how many squares were present and multiplied one by the other."
1793,Ive tried to look every row of people and multiplied by the number of people in each row 
475,"Thinking of an average of how many people were in each row. Also just guessing by looking at the picture, and by the number of hats/helmets"
186,I looked at the average number of people per row which was around five to six rows and I multiplied that by 60 to 50 people and I would assume it was around 300 odd people
769,I counted 10 people across and 10 people down. Once i had a rough idea of how much space 100 people took i estimated how many people would fit into the space i could see.
1850,"I looked at roughly how much space 10 people took up, then used that to estimate how much space 100 people took up. I used that to estimate how much space 1000 people took up and from there I guessed 1500."
1015,"I counted the number of dots in the longest section of the picture, then multiplied it by the number of rows I could see . Then made an approximation  "
17,I took an estimate of a certain area then determined how many of those 'areas' fit in to the whole picture to try to determine how many people there were
212,"Looks like about a tenth of an oval, approx 30000 seater stadium."
136,Estimate of average number of rows multiplied by average number of columns.
1722,I tried to count a small part of the image an then multiple for the full scale
972,"Wild guess. I think I'm bad at estimating crowds, so I doubled the number I initially thought."
602,I looked at the picture seen a large amount of people and just made a random guess
1881,"I counted the amount of person in one row, and multiplied it by the amount of rows I saw, randomly adding 20 to 40 more people per row for the longer ones, subtracting 20-30 for the lower ones. Then in the top sections I guessed they had around 200 people each, so I added those up"
1827,"Tried to count a bit. Than noticed it got to small, than made a guess "
1063,Counted 10 dots at the top and created a 'size area' then i mentally spread that throughout the image in my mind. I did the same for the bottom half.
141,very roughly tried to estimate number of people in row and how many rows
926,I counted the number of people in a small space then estimated the number of similar spaces in the picture and multiplied the number of the space by the number of people I counted in the original space.
417,"The crowd looked roughly the size of the away end of my favourite football team, so I estimated there to be roughly the same number of people there"
910,I counted some in a small area and then just estimated how many might be in total.
635,"I thought about how many people watch professional baseball, and number of rows in the picture."
1705,I count the number of a group and group them into circle and count the approximate number of circles in the photo. Approximate No of people in circles X No of circles = total approximate no of people
1160,i looked at the blue dots representing each person and then i made my decision 
1403,I just looked at the photo and guessed how many people there were.
116,"there are areas more crowded and less crowded. divide these area, and get a round number of the divided area, and sum the number up."
1427,I picked an area that seemed to have about ten people and then estimated how many of those areas were in the picture and then multiplied that by ten. 
741,I tried to determine where 10 people were and then how many groups of 10 would be in each row
1054,I counted the number of blue dots going left to right then down to up and multiplied them together. I also rounded it up because of the higher volume of people towards the top
312,I guesstamated
1733,I had to estimate the number of peaople shown in a large crowd
1317,Added up one row of people (roughly) & multiplied it by estimate of number of rows.
430,"I divided the crowd into two sections, the top one that was more concentrated and the bottom one which was more diffused. I then grouped the first ten people from one section and loosely estimated how many groups of ten people there were horizontally and vertically, and mutilplied that number and then did the same with the oher section."
128,I first thought this was a snapshot of the whole arena and had therefore a much bigger figure in mind. Then realised it was only the picture so realised it was about 10% of my original estimation.
574,I tried to estimate the number in each row vertically and horizontally in the 2 different sections and multiple them.
181,I looked at the picture and evaluated by eyes how many people could be in  each row
27,I just did a wide scan and analysed in detail how many people (approximately) would be in a certain section then went by instinct and rough estimation. 
1583,"I counted rough how many people were vertical, and how many horizontal side and made a rough calculation."
1502,quickly added up the top row and multiplied by columns roughly
709,Count the people in the picture
1325,I just count few people and try to multiple them. I can't really say because this was purely guess not the calculation
1259,Made an initial assumption that all blue dots are individual people. Then counted a block of people from the picture. 
1314,"I divided the crowd into smaller sections to try and estimate the area occupied by 50ish people, then divided the crowd in smaller groups that I thought contained around 50 people"
1,I tried to count a row of people but lost focus so just chose to estimate based on remembering an average stadium size and about how many blue squares there were more or less and multiplicated that by the approximate rows.
576,visualize a crowd of people in a soccer match
1418,Roughly counting some of the nearest blue dots and multiplying. But ultimately guessing! 
448,"I calculated a rough idea of people per column in the middle, then halfed it as they weren't all as long. Then did the same for rows and multiplied. "
1256,I counted in seconds going slowly from left to right (i.e. roughly counting the blue dots) and did the same going from top to bottom. Multiplying both numbers and rounding upwards gave me my answer. 
79,"I counted a block of 25 working out a rough size, then counted blocks"
846,Tried to picture this as a stadium Iâve visited 
130,guessed how many were in a row and then guessed how many rows and multiplied
962,I guessed
1176,"It wasn't easy to determine, I had to take an estimated guess"
1653,I used the dots to count the number of rows and multiplied it by the number of people that I think were on each row.
810,Tried to count across & down
1505,I estimated how.many people were approx in the first 2 rows then multiplied and estimated the rest of the stadium.
1872,Estimated front to back and left to right and multiplied. Also used my knowledge of arpund 400 people in a hall
1769,I tried to estimate as well as i could what percent of the stadium that was and estimated it was a stadium with a capacity of 40000
971,First stept was to assess whether the rows were of same length or dot density. Then try to estimate how many rows were excessively shorter or longer than the others. Then estimated the number of people on the image.
710,counted one of what I thought looked like an average row and multiplied by number of rows
370,"I judged what size 100 people would take up in the photo, and then determine how many lots of this size would fit in the photo."
346,Imagined it being part of a stadium that I know the capacity of
156,Did a mental 10x10 square and tried to see how many of them fit in the picture.
1608,"1st I took a wild guess of 1000. Then I counted the people on a middle row, and an counted the number of rows (an estimate, didn't count anything too precisely.) So i multiplied both and got 1100. Decided to go with my initial guess."
733,I honestly just gave my best guess and didnât use any kind of strategy.
240,By estimating the amount of rows and the people each row would accomodate
977,I estimated that there would be 50 people per line and there would be 50 lines of people. I added 100 people for adjustment purposes.
603,I tried to count how many people were in one row and multiplied that by the amount of rows I saw. I reduced it once I saw the shorter rows of people. I 
262,Counted the number of blue dots in the middle row and then estimated the number of rows then multiplied. Given the rows get smaller as they go down I took a little off. 
1721,"I sort of grouped together a group of ten, and then roughly counted the groups I could see. "
707,"I originally thought 20,000 would fill a stadium, so a quarter of that would be 5,000"
407,Estimated how many rows there were and how many in each row.
1059,"Counted the number in a small area, then estimated a larger area, build across the whole picture"
686,count how many people in a small square. estimate how many sqares per length and height.  multiply out as a very rough guide to total in picture.  then i doubled as there will be more people per square further back.
1753,Just making decisions about very important things in the study. I Just hope I'll be a good he3.
307,I tried to work out what would a avg stadium size and went with a 4th.
289,Divided the picture into sections. I then roughly counted how many in one section and multiplied it.
1328,divide into unit and estimate the unit qty
606,It was very much a gut feeling type of decision with no skill needed
640,"Calculated how many in a row, then multiplied by how many rows and then multiplied by number of columns"
700,I just tried to imagine similar venues I had been in and the capacity 
843,gut feelings
248,"Counted the amount of people in a corner, approx, and timesed it by ~6. I looked at approx a 6th of the screen."
1151,it is something different for me
413,I sectioned off each row into groups of approximately 10 people then multiplied it by the number of rows. It was my best estimate but probably way out!
1654,"Using my past experience of being in a full stadium, I just guessed how many people may have been pictured based on that."
1405,I tried to count/estimate how many people were in a particular row and then determine how many rows there were. This gave me figure and I then rounded it up for good measure.
84,"couned number of people in a row, counted number of rows, counted what appeared to be sections and got 6, muliplied number in row by number of rows by sections"
1790,"I thought, maybe 50 people per section, looked like 8 sections, 400? I was pretty confident. I'm also almost certain I am wrong, heh."
983,"Looked like only a section of a larger stadium, so used smaller venue capacity as a reference."
75,i counted a section of people then multiplied it
1257,Just a best guess
1003,I tried counting rows and estimated
522,Based on the amount of dots and lines 
109,Started counting the area with the lower density of dots.  Then I counted how many dots were in a larger cluster of dots and multiplied that by an estimated amount of clusters.
721,"I just... thought about it. I don't even know. Considered how many people a stadion can hold, broke it down to the shown section and just estimated the number. "
390,"i tried to picture 100 people and then use it for this picture, but i kinda scrapped that and though about allianz arena in munich which holds 70k ppl so this part seeemd like abt 14k ppl for me"
1635,"I looked at a small selection, guessed how many people were in it, and then guessed how many such groups would fit into the photo."
132,"Quick count of one section for bottom tier, then multiplied that, top tier more of a guess"
575,"split the screen into sections, counted the dots in 1 square and multiplied it by the total squares, then added a couple"
767,Estimated by stadiums Iâve been in of a similar looking size 
107,I estimated the number of people per row 
1454,I went off typical stadium sizes and capacities that I commonly know of. I then factored in that this is just a section of an arena. Most arenas hold 20000 people total
87,"Thought about large crowds I had been in (at concerts, graduation, ect) and how many people I knew were in those crowds.  Made an estimation based on that."
1479,i just tried to quickly estimate the number of dots horizontally and vertically. it was not very exact.
1071,tried to group in 10s then 100s and guessed how many of those groups were present
239,I counted up a small section of people in the picture and multiplied the number for the rest of the photo.
571,Approximately each block of seats 15x30. There are two full blocks plus one half.
1776,I did an estimation of one row of people a particular stand and then used that estimation to determine a reasonable figure of how many people were in the picture overall.
532,"Assumed a grid-like formation, then multiplied the top row by the amount of people along the aisle of each subsequent side seat of each row."
1599,I tried to count one row and then multiplies it
151,Just a guess. An educated guess. 
945,"knowing a stadiums capacity, complex math"
748,I actually think I exaggerated. But I was making small groups of people (more or less of 100) and I counted several of them.
59,"At first I tried to count a line of heads"" but I wasn't able to because they were too many and the image was a bit blurry. So I thought that it looked like it could be more than 1000 but less than 5000"""
1235,I tried to cut and count a segment in my mind and calculate the rest of the image based on the segment.
1121,Estimate with a guess how many rows of 100 there are
906,It was okay
1051,There were more people farther away clumped up than on the left side and assumed there had to be at least 3 times as many on the right.
775,I gave an estimate based on how many rows of people were shown
1062,i counted approximate amount of people in one line and then approximated how many lines of people there were. Then I multiplied these 2 numbers together to get a rough total number.
81,I counted the top row of people then also counted the left line of people then multiplied it with the row i then made a close estimation based on my calculations
223,I tried to do a length x width calculation and also guesstimated based on stadium sizes and how much of the stadium was in the shot
1279,Just guessing by taking a look 
572,"counted vertically middle blue points, around 40, them counted horizontally to around 50. 40*50"
832,Counted a few rows and multiplied them
1204,I mainly took in the scale of the picture. Then I tried to estimate based on the number of heads in each row of people.
102,I estimated one side of the crowd and then tripled that amount
754,It was honestly just a guesstimate because the people look really small but there were several of them 
855,"Divided picture into 8ths, picked an 8th with medium looking density. counted and then multiplied by 8 and rounded."
804,I was thinking about a big stadium fitting 20000 people. Because I only saw a small part I estimated this number
1136,Estimated 25 person in a row at 20 rows
1120,looked  at the rough number of rows and estimated how many on each row in a block
183,From experience 
1348,"I enlarged the picture to see with more detail, it looks like each blue point is a head or face. The I proceeded to give a guess based on the amount of blue points."
979,I tried to count roughly across and then upwards and try and multiply them together 
244,i though about the fact there are probably more people than my estimate so i guessed and then added a third again.
986,"A football stadium stand holds around 2000, the photo showed roughly a stand in a stadium"
1169,Guessing capacity of overall sports ground then estimated relative size of segment shown.
90,I counted what 10 people looked like (how much space they took up). Then estimated how many 100 took up and counted in approximate hundreds
375,I tried to count a small section and then multiply it by roughly how many times I thought that repeated 
1650,"It was a complete guess, nothing more"
1086,I made a general count across and lenghtwise and multiplied
1497,"I basically just treated the crowd as a rectangle, took an approximate number for the length"" and ""width"" in number of people"
431,"Just looked at the picture, thought a bit about how big stadiums are, and just guessed."
1725,this crowd is similliar to all the learners at my former school at asemly and we had 1700 leaners thats how i decribed it
1409,I counted how many were in the corner at bottom left - 17 - then made a rough estimate of how many multiples of that area were present.
304,"Roughly counted how many dots were and each side, average the top and bottom and left and right and then multiplied them."
580,I tried to estimate how many blue dots there were and sectioned them off into sections 
1091,"I counted the blue dots in an area that looked to be of an average density and then multiplied the number from there, based on the amount of times that area would cover the picture. I then rounded up the number to give my estimate."
1149,I counted about 10 people in the bottom left corner and assumed that's how many people fit into the row this size. Then multiplied it and summed it up.
96,"I compared it to football crowds I've been in, counting rough amounts of 100s."
476,I compared the crowd with similar sized crowds I've been in from the past. I knew the attendances from those crowds and used the figures to estimate the crowd size in the picture.
447,I couldn't find a way I just guessed my best logical guess
1603,Same size as arena near my house 
1334,"Way more than 10 people in a row(not counted), more than 10 rows, so definitely way more than a 100 people. 1000 seemed reasonable (maybe a bit high but it's a nice rounded number)."
1419,"I thought about sports and concert venues I've attended and their capacity, then tried to convert that into how much of those venues the people in the picture would take up. Then I tried to convert that to a number "
1122,"I very roughly counted the number or rows, and estimated the number of people in each row by eye, then multiplied."
789,saw the approx space of 10 people and counted the rows and took off approximations where the picture ended
468,just average size of a stadium with that many rows with fans in all the spots 
435,Very vague guess
1029,"I made an estimate by looking at the image. It's a little difficult to say the exact number, since there are really a lot of people."
49,I tried to estimate how many rows of people there were and then how many seats per row and multiplied the two.
398,I tried looking up roughly how many rows are there and how dense they seemed looking from left to right 
1078,I just made the best guess. I looked at how small each person was and saw how big the whole picture was and made a choice. 
1734,I tried to compare it to a local stadium with a capacity of around 60000.
1142,"I seperated the crowd into 3 sections based on their density. Then I counted across how many dots there were roughly in a 'row', then multiplied that number by roughly how many 'rows's there are in each section."
757,Just a guestimate 
694,"I imagined that the entire stadium had a capacity for 40,000 people and that that segment was 1/16 of the total"
1258,I didn't really have to think about it too much. I just guessed that there is usually thousands of people at a stadium so a slice of that similar to the picture would probably be about 1000 people.
1585,Counted people in rows and columns and multiplied them
1833,Best guess
611,I just noticed the density of people
1560,"I counted maybe halfway through one row, and estimated the rest of the row. Then guessed based off how many rows I felt there were."
1610,"count a row in a segment then multiply by the number of tiers to get an estimate in each segment, then count the segments while putting the incomplete segments together to form whole ones"
1796,"I tried to figure out what size area 10 people are in, then tried to count how many of that size 'area' is in the picture. I then tried to account for perspective a bit, by making the 10 person areas a bit bigger towards the foreground"
1295,Multiplying an estimated amount of blue points from the top with the left side.
69,"Tried to count heads within one row, then counted how many rows down, then multiplied by # of sections"" that I could. I used the bottom left section as a reference. Rounded up to an even number because of the curvature of the picture and therefore more/less people were shown in each section. """
848,I imagined groups of about 100 people and guessed how many groups there are
1312,"I counted across 10 blue dots from right to left, then judged the distance accrossways to be about 10 times that amount. I then estimated there to be around 25 rows, but allowed for the curve of the stand, so knocked a few off."
481,"Rough count of a fraction of the picture, then how many times that fraction is covered  "
529,"I estimate that there are around 100 people for around 3 lines, so it is around 500 in total."
1244,counted the number of blue hats per square cm of the image and then tried to calculate the total area of the entire photograph
140,I just guessed 
753,I based it on what my school hall looked like when full and that was around 200 people
55,"I thought about a stadium and kinda tried to remeber how many people aprox. there are in biggest stadiums, then I went to think what number the division of that would be, and by looking at the photo you can determine that its like 1/5 or 1/6 of the whole stadium, so if total stadium would fit around 30,000 people, here we could look at 500-1000 or something like that. Now thinking about it, its probably a bigger number, something around 2,000-5,000. I am very bad with number to be honest)."
1740,I just count 10 people and guessed the size of the picture.
243,thought about size of spoting stadium and tied to esrtimate the cross-section
818,I looked at how many people might be in a section and what that would look like multiplied. Basically how many people would be there realistically.
1619,Just an estimate based on my perception of the crowd.
1390,"Judged from a football stadium point of view, new lfc stand has 10000 seats and looks a similar size of the photo shown so its by best guesstimate"
976,I tried to figure out what 100 people looked like. Then just counted similar sections to get to a total.
713,"Very quickly estimated what 100 blue circles looked like, and then estimated how many sets of 100 were in the photo"
1897,"Just intuition, the number felt right"
1301,compared the size of my school to the amount of people shown in the picture
1642,I made a non educated guess on how many blue dots I could count.
1252,"Picked a rough square to count, counted the faces in the square, then counted squares along the row left to right. After getting a row count counted the rows down the image the bottom adjusting slightly for some of the less dense rows."
539,"I began with the bottom left quadrant of the picture and then moved to the bottom right quadrant, then top left (above the balcony) and top right. For each section I roughly doubled my previous total based on the perspective and density of blue dots. "
610,Its alot of people was rough guess based on how close together people are 
1453,"I did my best to count the number of people in one row, then tried to count the number of rows. This was easier for the bottom half, the top half was more of an estimation. "
854,Same size as the arena in my area 
1379,I looked at the crowd and tried to count some people in a row. Then I estimated how many would be on a singular row and then tried to guess how many people would be in the crowd overall.
330,"I counted a small area and there were already 20 dots, and looking at the picture of assume all these people are at some kind of venue, the size of the picture captures alot of people so I just guessed 20 thousand"
404,Î counted a row and tried to multiply keeping in mind that the above rows were more dense than the bottom ones
736,"I watched soocer game a lot , so I try my best to guess for my memory"
1283,Did a rough count of rows and people per row and multiplied them 
1031,"loosely counted the people in a vertical line and horizontal line to form a square calculated the area, then added it several times"
649,I divided the image into 10 x 10 sections (in my head) and then quickly counted dots in the top left and bottom left sections. I then averaged and multiplied by 100. My final step was to adjust the number down on gut feeling.
1006,I just guessed using the rows and size of area and how many people it may hold.
1133,roughly row x columns
131,"First guess the footprint of 100 people, then see how many of the footprint in total"
1854,It was a really rough estimate 
1311,I first counted the line in the middle and then saw that the average was about a hundred. I think counted how many lines there were and multiplied by that number. I did however take into account that not all of the lines were full therefore counted and averaged took the number down. I believe there are about 2000 people approximate.
101,I just looked at all the people and gave it a guess
272,"Looking at the number of heads, one could easily guess that there was no place to sit and that stadium was at its full capacity with tickets sold out for the match"
1493,I roughly estimated the number by counting the number in a row and multiplying that by the number of rows. Not very accurate!
1093,I tried to just guess how many blue dots there were. It kind of looked like it could be around 600.
1193,i had to guess the number of people in the picture. It was not super easy beacuse it looked like a lot of people but I may have overestimated 
584,"I looked at the spread of the blue dots and based on my own experience of stadiums, guessed what a block of that kind of size would hold. "
106,"It looks like itâs split into sections so Iâve assumed thereâs about 100people per section, thinking about previous events Iâve been to"
860,It was taugh cant astimate the number of people 
25,I tried count the first row and how many rows are there. I couldnt get a precise number but estimated then multiplied those to get my final estimation  
1867,Tried to roughly count about how many people were in each section and concluded there were about 100. There looked to be 10 sections.
1096,Just guessed based on what I think 100 people looked like and went of that
1305,"I tried to select an area that I judged to contain about one hundred people, then counted the number of areas of that size contained within the whole image."
1553,I looked at a small section and guessed how many I thought would be in that bit then multiplied it by how many more sections there was left 
1000,"Briefly counted the rows across and down, approximately. "
1744,"I tried counting roughly how many people are in one row and trying to multiply that with the amount of rows but then I just gave up halfway and then thought it was roughly 1,200 people."
1580,Just counted a couple of rows then guessed
1101,I counted a small section of blue dots in one corner then made a judgement of how many areas of that size were along each side of the photo and multiplied them together. 
1851,Counting the front row 
1168,I just went randomly with what I felt was right
1892,"Counter a few people in one area and then counted equivalent areas, multiplied total base on original area number "
1632,I tried to see how many people were in a random row (vertically) and then made a guess about how many rows were on each tier. I think I probably underestimated.
1538,I counted roughly the number or rows of seats and then the number of people in an average visible row. It wasnât completely clear so some of it was a rough measurement by sight of how many people I could see in one section and extrapolating that to the length and width of the photo to determine people per row and number of rows. 
1288,counted number of people in the first row and multiplied

Then for the bottom area where people seemed to be dispersed, I re-counted a group of 10 people and used that to estimate how many people were in the bottom area. I also estimated that if the people were as crowded as they were in the top of the image throughout the whole image then there would be around 10 000 people, so since they were less dispersed in the bottom, the number had to be less than 10 000."

440,"I tried to count a few rows up and down, then thought about how many sections a stadium holds and made a rough estimate!"
1413,"i counted the top row (approx. 50 people) and the left column (approx. 15) and i multiplied, estimating around 750"
1159,Just a random number 
1432,"I counted the approximate number of dots from the top down, then used that to estimate the amount of dots horizontally. Then I multiplied the two figures, 20 x 40 and got 800 and I added an extra 200 to make it 1000 since 800 seemed too low"
658,I counted a small area and multiplied  by 100
491,made a rough guess
179,"I sized it up, just eyeballed it. I figured I would underestimate it so I went with a larger number."
410,based on how many people were at a concert I went to
873,guessing the number of people in a stadium
1084,I just thought of the stadium size and average capacity and compared it to the amount of stadium shown in picture.
692,"I estimated the top right corner using a combination of counting and guesstimating.  I then applied this through the whole picture, allowing for the top halfe being much more occupied than the bottom half.  I'd love to know how far out I was!"
40,Looked at the size of area and number of people in it
1287,I started by trying to work out how many in a certain portion of the picture and then how many portions of the same size for into the entire picture
1485,I estimated the number of people based on my estimation of the number of people in a football stadium I attend regularly 
799,Roughly counted rows and columns and multiplied.
1209,"I tried to count how many people were in an area the size of my finger. I then estimated how many fingers covered the whole picture. Finally, I multiplied the two numbers. "
1282,"I isolated how big of a group is roughly 10 people, and then I tried to identify how many times it fits into the picture."
746,"I tried to imagine the usual largest groups of people that I would normally see. Classrooms of 30-45, assemblies of multiple classes (200-300 hundred) and put about 3 of those together. My other guesses were 600 and 1200, but felt 700'ish would be reasonable."
1217,I just did a quick estimate 
492,counted the rows then estimated around 50 people per partial row.
1141,I realised that it was a section of a sports stadium and worked out the average sports stadium capacity and the fact that the image shows the full section of a small part of the stadium
732,I guessed as it looks like a lot of people
647,I guessed randomly i just took a gamble
1807,A total guess
1455,I guesed 
1400,"Counted the little dots up til 10, then tried to guesstimate how many groups of 10 there were"
31,"i thought that all the blue circles was a person face, and then i looked to the rest of the crowd and i stimate that there are around 200-250 people there"
1739,"Counted along one row for twenty, then estimated how many groups of twenty were in one row.  Then tried to count roughly how many rows there were and multiplied them by the number in the first row."
162,i counted the number of people on the first roll then try to multiply it
104,Just a guess. Due to the changes in perspective at a distance it wasnât possible to extrapolate from one section which was the initial plan 
891,"So basically, if I was correct, I imagined that I divided the picture in little squares. In each of the squares I guess there were about 50 people or so. I counted the squares and then calculated."
338,Guessed that every arena can probably hold close to 20000 people and estimated what portion of the arena we were seeing.
1484,"I looked closely to see how ten people looked like as a group, and then this gave me a general idea of roughly how many 100 would be. The people on the top level appear very closely packed due to perspective and there really is a very sizable number up there."
752,"I started off by counting the blue dots in a small section, and then I grouped the same size in different sections as I estimated the size of the crowd.."
23,I multiplied the rows together. Then imagined how many people there would be in that section of the stadium based on a game in Australia.
1647,I looked at grouping of people. I tried to put them into groups of 10.
342,I tried to roughly group together 100 people in the image and estimate how many blocks of 100 there were.
1280,I just made a note of the dotted blue marks. I estimated how many rows there were and just made a rough estimate by mutlipying the rows together
1035,I tried to visualize what a 100-people crowd would look like and then I use this proportion to try to calculate the whole surface.
1590,Counted the first two rows multiplied by 12 and then added 200
295,"I thought about how many people fit in a Premier League stadium, and thought about the size of crowd in the picture. How many of those could I fit into a stadium and made a best estimate."
1756,I counted one row and guesstimated from there. Taking into consideration the fact that the number would increase or decrease based on the length of the row
70,I counted up one section at the front. After that I multiplied that by the number of sections on the bottom. After that I did the same at the top and added the totals together.
349,I divided the people up in to a sample area made a calculation on that area then estimated how many of that area would fit in the photo and multiplied the number again to get my result.
1030,Asked to look at a picture of a sports crowd and to have a rough guesstimate of how many people were there. 
578,"Tried counting the heads on a section, then  I guessed the rest."
221,analysed what a portion of 10 people looked like and multiplied it at much as i could see.
1861,The crowd is a lot but not too full to an extent that you can kinda estimate how many people are there. 
1450,I estimated based on the size of crowd at a football stadium I attend regularly and my estimation of crowd size there
483,"Attempted to count number of people in one line, which helped me to roughly estimate how many might be in the total photo."
137,I took a segment of the crowd in the lower left hand corner and estimated 45 people. I looked at the picture and decided that around 40 x 45 people might be in the picture
412,"I counted 10 people and looked at the size of the area they covered, and then I guessed based on that."
1506,"30 rows, and 50 sears plus extra"
678,I compared it to Leeds Arena and then estimated from there.
1313,"I loosely counted about a grouping of ten, and then extrapolated how many groupings of that size is within the photo."
1097,"The picture looks as though to be taken from a concert/stadium setting and seems to show one side/corner of such an arena. I would estimate that a corner of an arena of such size would hold around 500 people, based on the number of rows back the crowd seems to go. There are not many tiers, only two that I can see."
1747,"I started with trying to figure out how many in the front row, plus second row, plus 3rd row and then when I figured I had 20% counted I multiplied that number by 5"
458,"a guess based on the lower half of the section, by counting the rows"
1802,I estimated by looking at the top row of people and extrapolating the number to all the rows. 
1415,I thought for a moment how many people can fit in a place like that
1307,I counted the dots along the bottom of the picture and the dots along the right side. Then I multiplied the one number by the other.
276,I estimated about 100 people and counted how many groups of 100 were in the picture
513,Split into groups with similar density. Divide each group by biggest countable blocks.
554,I just try to quees 
1339,"i literally just tried to guess, as i kept losing count trying to count the blue dots."
1073,I just guessed and tried to draw on past experiences of events where I knew how many people were there to see if I could think of any event where it looked like there was a similar amount of people to those shown in the photo.
119,I just estimated. I assumed that there less than 10000 but more than 1000.
592,"Counted the amount of people within half a row, multiplied by 2, then estimated how many rows were within the picture. Finally, the final number provided me with the anticipated number of people within the audience."
1098,"Count roughly how many people were there in one 'section' by counting how many people in a row, then multiply the number by the number of rows"
900,"Counted how much space 100 heads occupied and use that as a reference to estimate the total, also accounting the visual depth in the estimation."
1597,"I first looked at how crowded the place looked. Then I estimated the amount of area that about 100 people would take up. And then I figured, or estimated how many of those 100 people areas there were."
1612,"There's about 30 rows, and i figured maybe around 50 people per row"
443,I estimated the amount of people per block. 
1319,I go to university and my usual class fits around 100 people so i estimated using my classroom as reference
1667,I counted the half row and multiplied it by the vertical row to get an approximate number.
1629,"my school year had 180 students, so i envisioned our assembly and kinda imagined it more compact and applied it to this"
436,I compared it to a football stadium and then tried to come up with a reasonable number.
1847,I determined how many people are in a certain viscinity and came with a conclusion of the total number of the people in the crowd.
911,"It was a guess, I zoomed in on an area and did a rough count and then estimated the number "
795,I tried to remember other mass events where I was present and I know approximately how many people attended 
1099,I kind of looked at the picture in âchunksâ of 100
978,Just counting a portion of the blue dots and using that to guesstimate the rest
922,I tried to divide the picture roughly into quarters and estimate the number of people in each quarter. I quickly scanned each quarter and counted the blue dots in my head. Then I multiplied this number by 4.
782,looked at a very small section and counted heads. Then tried to work out how many of those small sections made up the crowd.
612,Guessed
1144,I counted a group of about ten people to start and used their grouping as a reference for the rest of the crowd essentially seeing how many groups of ten their were. 
1804,"counted an estimate of how many people were in one row, then counted number of columns from top, reached an approximate"
1532,I was asked to estimate hoe many people were on a photo of a stadium
684,"I have done puzzles in the past where I have had to estimate the number of dots in a square, so I tried to draw on this experience. I observed the photo and tried to come up with an estimate.I tend to estimate numbers below the actual number so I added a few hundred to my answer to account for this. "
1155,guessed how many was about 50 people and how much space they took up multiplied it.
416,"Tried to imagine a part of a 80,000 capacity stadium and guess I could see about 5% of the stadium."
124,"blocks of 75 from bottom, but increasing as they went up the picture"
998,"I estimated how many people roughly on each row and then estimated how many rows, then multiplied both numbers."
1147,i try to count a small part and then divide the picture into different parts. i used multiplication.
493,"I estimated a group of ten, then doubled up until I got to an estimate of one hundred.  I then used this estimate and used it to guess the total by grouping blocks of approximately one hundred."
981,i thought about the fact that everytime i think of situations like this and than find out the number its always way more than i thougt so i inicialy thought 200 so i doubled it
176,Complete guess probably quite overstated but I tend to find that you underestimate the size of crowds 
1719,I compared it to the standing section of my local football (soccer) stadium as I thought it looked a reasonably similar size crowd.
1459,"Honestly just went on instinct, no real counting method."
593,"Estimated people.in each row and colimn, and then multiplied them"
1751,I mistakenly put 100 instead of my guess which is 1000. I counted one square and multiply the ratio of that square with the whole pic as estimation.
1228,Looked at the rows. roughly estimated how many would be in each row and added a few extra numbers as I guessed there would be more people than just the blue dots
285,My guess was made up from the seats arrangement in other to accommodate am much needed guests similar to a stadium setup
1823,"I moved along rows and counted 10, and moved along again and counted 10 again. I then moved up blocks and counted 10 until I had covered the entire picture area, and came to an estimated people number total."
1049,"Gauged the size of a small area and then extrapolated out, very roughly."
457,Counting the rows and number of people in the row. Doing a quick estimation 
1754,I had to estimate how much people are in the photo. I didn't count it i just tried to work on my eyesight and intuition
725,guessed by on the size of venue 
808,Just kind of assessed how big a group of five was then made a wild guess 
1290,Counted the heads of each row multiply by a how many rows. Just added it up plus or minus the cut off part of the photo. 
1871,I based it off of previous views of sporting events and reported capacities
874,I tried to count the heads according to rows and then sum
372,Estimating the number of people in the rows and columns. 
573,"I counted a small subsection of the image, then using the size those individuals took up as a baseline estimate, I went around the image counting a similar space and adding that value to my total count. I noted that the top section had a lot more people present in that area so I added a little more to the total to account for the more densely occupied area too."
1272,i chcecked how many of them are in 1 row. or i just tried to check
901,It reminded me of an arena where I've been to watch concerts. I thought of the capacity and tried to guess how many would be in that section.
1677,"I tried to count 1 row across and seemed about 100 people and looked like 20 rows down, so 100x20 was my guess"
892,"I took a patch I estimated at 100 people, and estimated how many times that patch repeated"
50,counting roughly how many are in a row and timesing it by how many rows there are rougy
341,I estimated the number of people in the picture.
1179,I counted the rows and stimate how many people in a row is
521,"Looked at the density of blue dots in a 2x2 square and then made a guess as to the overall size, trying to take into account if the density differed in certain areas."
63,"First I tried to count the number of dots in a portion of the photo, but theyâre hard to distinguish. I thought about the type of venue the photo appears to be and then just made an educated guess."
391,I guessed the size of a smaller area and multiplied it ..
1901,"Count 10 heads. Extrapolated,"
506,I counted one line completely and then tried to multiply it by each line I saw so I could more or less deduce how many people were in the photo.
1250,I tried to estimate the number in each row taking into account thus varied by row. I tried to get an impression of the amount of the blue dots shown. I also relied on a gut feeling.
850,"I took a pretty loose approach, it looked to be about 1000."
1644,Just had a quick scan of the crowd and gave an educated guess
1359,I looked closely at density and tried to approximate how many heads I lcould count per cm square then multiplied. I tried to ignore the blue dots as they were deceptive. It wasnât easy at all and Iâve no idea how close my estimate may be so the actual figure. 
917,Counted a group of 10 to see how big it was and then multiplied by how many sections it looked like there was. Then the depth increased people so I might but over by a couple hundred
655,I tried to count the number of people in a section of the image and then scale that up. It felt very imprecise and was hard to count individuals accurately even in a small section.
543,I counted 10 people then looked how much room they took up and compared it to the size of the image
201,"I counted the number of people down the side on the bottom, then guestimated how many rows there were and added. Then I used my best judgement to guess. I honestly cannot tell if I was close or not. "
123,I just estimated how many in a row and the how many rows I can see. I estimated this through just counting the amount of heads I see in a row.
803,I compared it to a football stadium crowd and estimated accordingly
1878,I guessed how big a size of 100 blue dots was then I estimated how many of those 100 blocks there were in the whole picture
1401,I've segmented the picture in what i thought was 100 people and used that segment as a reference
865,It was really a random guess.  I started blocking off parts and estimating how many in each block.  Then I gave up.
761,Just picked a number from the top of my head
1712,Estimated arenas i have seen and judged based on capacity of the places. 
1844,I honestly just guessed. 
705,roughly estimated by how many blue dots i could see
18,I started by looking at the picture i think by the size of it and i came up with a number 
1800,I compared it to the standing section of my local football (soccer) stadium as I thought it looked a reasonably similar size crowd.
219,"I started by counting how many people on one of the middle rows. I then counted the number of rows, and multiplied the answers together. I then took a few off as not all of each row is visible "
1481,"Split the crowd into a square, estimated the number in a row and the binder of rows, multiplied these figures. Then estimated the remainder based on the relative area of those sections compared to the square mentioned earlier."
1134,I quickly estimated the number people in one row and then number upwards then multiplied.
1567,Roughly counted the amount of people horizontally and vertically and multiplied them. 
1520,"I tried to quickly count the number of blue dots in a middle line in the bottom section. Once I had a number from there, I counted the rows and estimated how many in total there were"
1486,"I am just going by how many for each section"" and then try to get an estimate number of sections. The section x amount of people = my estimate"""
1749,I estimated the number of people per row.
1572,Guessed a rough average of people in each row and the number of rows
1333,I just tried to guess looking at the picture realistically
770,I estimated about how much would be 100 people and pieced together in sections.
439,First I tried counting people in an area and figuring how many times it repeated over the space 
228,thought about stadiums i know capacity of and attempted to reference to them 
1377,First of all I zoomed in on the picture to get a better look. I then divided the picture in two on the horizontal and estimated how many people were in a small section of each and then estimated what all these added together would be.
1100,Looked at the number if rows and people multiplied then added sone extra
813,I tried counting down from the top left part of the image down vertically and counting the blue dots in one single line and then estimated how many lines of crowds there are and then just multiplied it together to roughly approximate the crowd in my brain.  
570,Counted a block of 100 and applied it across the photo
499,My guess was made up of the seats arrangement which tends to accommodate an much needed guests.
1791,I counted one line and then estimated the amounts based on the size and number of the line I counted. I then added a bit on top for good measure for the denser areas
65,rough count of rows and then multiplied by a very rough estimate of the lines
1489,I lookied atcthe rows and approximate how many people we in a row and mutiplied it by the appropriate number of rows.
461,"Estimating how many heads there were per row (100 to 200), and then multiplying by the number of rows. Plus adding a couple of hundred more for rows where visibility of heads was low"
763,Made a visual measurement of a vertical segment of the image with a width equal to a centimetre and counted the number of blue dots within it and then multiplied that number by the length of the image.
1261,I have done a thoughtful guess based on the rows and columns.
1865,"Thought about the setting and what it was similar to, so thought of stadium seating on one side, similar to the picture."
665,"I counted the density in what looked like a seated section. Then roughly measured how many similar sized sections there were in the photo,"
1153,"It was just a guess, the image is not clear enough to work out a grid for capacity which can then be used to estimate the number of people in the image."
1645,Considered sizes of crowds in stadiums Iâve been in and then tried to compare to estimate.
1729,"I tried to count the best I could across one section and the rows of the same section. I multiplied, then judged approximately how close to size the other groupings were to the first one. I added them together. "
30,I counted as many individual dots as I could. I also thought about how many people a full stadium would hold and went from that overall number to guess how many could be in the photo.
1797,Imagined bigger circles
159,"I assumed its a stadium, with that section of people covering a quarter of the stadium"
1026,just averaged it out on the space as to what ve seen in other places and numbers there
1232,i just guess the capacity of a stadium quater
1398,I started to count and then made an aproximate guess.
1811,I just guessed
215,I looked at the amount of the blue dot and made an estimate from it
1475,I counted five people across and then 20 people down then used that estimate and used it to count all of the people
1745,My guess was made up of seats arrangements which is setup to accommodate as much needed guests
184,"I roughly counted a small portion, multiplied then used judgement to decide on a figure"
1002,Counted a quarter of the picture then x4
737,"I counted a group of about 30 people, then went around the picture counting more groups of more or less 30 people and adding them up."
629,"I divided the picture into 8, then counted the blue dots in one square, which was around 200. I multiplied it by 8, equaling 1600. I considered the diversity of density, so assumed it was around 2000."
1291,I examined the image and tried to come up with a reasonable estimation in my mind. 
1785,Counted the number of people per row multiplied my number of rows.
1330,"That is maybe an 1/6 of the stadium with 2 rings, a stadium that size takes maybe 25000 people, so in the end it's a guess"
599,Counted a quarter of the picture then x4
1146,I went with my gut answer of looking at the picture 
1447,"Overall It was a rough guess based on what stadium sections normally would hold and how large the area seemed in relation to the stadium size, also the seats mostly all looked taken so I thought the number might be higher than I was initially thinking "
980,there was no strategy. I just looked at the picture and took a guess.
927,I tried to estimate how many rows there were in the image and then estimate how many people per row there were and then multiply that together.
83,estimated based on a small portion of the image
508,"I've counted how many people, more or less, the longest row had, then multiplied it by the rough number of rows and finally substracted certain amount to round it down and account for other rows being shorter."
643,I just tried to guess at a glance without any specific calculations.
585,I counted the number of people sitting in one column and in one line and visually judged what number of people could be in the photo.
1382,I check the picture as someone who always go to soccer event and sometimes is oacked like on that picture and find out that side carry abt 12000 attendants so i thought the crowd is about 12000
1665,I tried to understand what kind of space the people were in and from there try to calculate a number that could resemble the image I was seeing. I thought it could be a football field whose dimensions were around 70/80 thousand people and one corner of that I assumed was around 15 thousand.
1387,"Estimated how many in the lowest row and the highest row of the lower deck , multiplied by an estimated number of rows with a gradual increase in estimate of number in each row. Then a similar process for the upper deck to get to a total."
155,Gut feeling
163,I counted one corner of people and then used that number to estimate the total number of people by multiplying it with the number of sections that looked equivalent to the size of the corner
579,I tried to count the number of people in one row and then multiply it by the number of rows. but in the end I still guessed
1397,Looked at the density of the area of people and estimated.
1137,I tried to count the members of the crowd but I know that it is a mission impossible. :)My estimation is 600 and I wonder if I'm right.
714,"I estimated the size of a rectangle that contained 20 people, estimated the width of that rectangle which came to about 10 along the top and the length of the rectangle was about 18 down the side.  So then multiplied 200 x 18 to get 3,600."
1187,i guessed how many were in the first row and then multiplied it by the number of rows. I thought it may be as accurate as I could estimate
1591,"split horizontally by width of finger - 15 fingers across. counted approx how many people in one vertical section, approx 50. 15 x50 is 750"
97,Counter to see how much close to 100 dots would be and just multiplied it across the whole picture.
668,Looks similar to my old school assemblies. School had ~2000 people
1817,"i estimatrd that one row of normal size is around 100 people, smaller size was around 50 people and counTed how many rows are at this picture"
1476,I looked at the blue dots and made the estimation.
326,I made a guess based upon the little blue dots and the different sections of the crowd. I also considered the size of the stadium and how much it could hold.
664,I counted down the numbers of letters in the alphabet and multiplied them by 200 in each section then added together plus 100 for anomalies.
182,i just estimated
1541,The image seems took from a big stadium/arena. I thought the number I gave was a plausible amount of people that could fit in an environment like that.
