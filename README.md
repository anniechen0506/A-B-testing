  - This document presents the analysis of data from a company that aimed to sell test kits to medical clinics in a new region using different sales approaches in an experiment.
  - The business problem is to test whether different sales approaches have different effects on conversion of clinics. In this experiment, sales team were randomly assigned to 3 different pitching methods for clinics.
   * Control: Clinics received the original "cost-focused" pitch.
   * Treatment 1: Clinics received the "easier to use" pitch.
   * Treatment 2: Clinics received the "fewer errors" pitch.
  - By conducting this experiment, the company aims to effectively convey the product pitch to doctors and nurse practitioners in the clinic, with the ultimate goal of boosting test kit sales and increasing the clinic conversion rate.
  - Calculate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) using R
